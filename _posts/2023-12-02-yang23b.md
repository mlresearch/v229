title: 'CAJun: Continuous Adaptive Jumping using a Learned Centroidal Controller'
section: Poster
openreview: MnANx01rV2w
abstract: We present CAJun, a novel hierarchical learning and control framework that
  enables legged robots to jump continuously with adaptive jumping distances. CAJun
  consists of a high-level centroidal policy and a low-level leg controller. In particular,
  we use reinforcement learning (RL) to train the centroidal policy, which specifies
  the gait timing, base velocity, and swing foot position for the leg controller.
  The leg controller optimizes motor commands for the swing and stance legs according
  to the gait timing to track the swing foot target and base velocity commands. Additionally,
  we reformulate the stance leg optimizer in the leg controller to speed up policy
  training by an order of magnitude. Our system combines the versatility of learning
  with the robustness of optimal control. We show that after 20 minutes of training
  on a single GPU, CAJun can achieve continuous, long jumps with adaptive distances
  on a Go1 robot with small sim-to-real gaps. Moreover, the robot can jump across
  gaps with a maximum width of 70cm, which is over $40%$ wider than existing methods.
