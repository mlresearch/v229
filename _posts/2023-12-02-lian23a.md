  and Tracking'
section: Poster

abstract: Recent multi-camera 3D object detectors usually leverage temporal information
  to construct multi-view stereo that alleviates the ill-posed depth estimation. However,
  they typically assume all the objects are static and directly aggregate features
  across frames. This work begins with a theoretical and empirical analysis to reveal
  that ignoring the motion of moving objects can result in serious localization bias.
  Therefore, we propose to model Dynamic Objects in RecurrenT (DORT) to tackle this
  problem. In contrast to previous global BirdEye-View (BEV) methods, DORT extracts
  object-wise local volumes for motion estimation that also alleviates the heavy computational
  burden. By iteratively refining the estimated object motion and location, the preceding
  features can be precisely aggregated to the current frame to mitigate the aforementioned
  adverse effects. The simple framework has two significant appealing properties.
  It is flexible and practical that can be plugged into most camera-based 3D object
  detectors. As there are predictions of object motion in the loop, it can easily
  track objects across frames according to their nearest center distances. Without
  bells and whistles, DORT outperforms all the previous methods on the nuScenes detection
  and tracking benchmarks with $62.8%$ NDS and $57.6%$ AMOTA, respectively. The source
  code will be available at https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/DORT.
