title: 'SLAP: Spatial-Language Attention Policies'
section: Poster
openreview: 7Pkzm2FgUmq
abstract: 'Despite great strides in language-guided manipulation, existing work has
  been constrained to table-top settings. Table-tops allow for perfect and consistent
  camera angles, properties are that do not hold in mobile manipulation. Task plans
  that involve moving around the environment must be robust to egocentric views and
  changes in the plane and angle of grasp. A further challenge is ensuring this is
  all true while still being able to learn skills efficiently from limited data. We
  propose Spatial-Language Attention Policies (SLAP) as a solution. SLAP uses three-dimensional
  tokens as the input representation to train a single multi-task, language-conditioned
  action prediction policy. Our method shows an $80%$ success rate in the real world
  across eight tasks with a single model, and a $47.5%$ success rate when unseen clutter
  and unseen object configurations are introduced, even with only a handful of examples
  per task. This represents an improvement of $30%$ over prior work ($20%$ given unseen
  distractors and configurations). We see a 4x improvement over baseline in mobile
  manipulation setting. In addition, we show how SLAPs robustness allows us to execute
  Task Plans from open-vocabulary instructions using a large language model for multi-step
  mobile manipulation. For videos, see the website: https://robotslap.github.io'
