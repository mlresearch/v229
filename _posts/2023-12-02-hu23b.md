title: 'Deception Game: Closing the Safety-Learning Loop in Interactive Robot Autonomy'
section: Poster
openreview: 0o2JgvlzMUc
abstract: An outstanding challenge for the widespread deployment of robotic systems
  like autonomous vehicles is ensuring safe interaction with humans without sacrificing
  performance. Existing safety methods often neglect the robot’s ability to learn
  and adapt at runtime, leading to overly conservative behavior. This paper proposes
  a new closed-loop paradigm for synthesizing safe control policies that explicitly
  account for the robot’s evolving uncertainty and its ability to quickly respond
  to future scenarios as they arise, by jointly considering the physical dynamics
  and the robot’s learning algorithm. We leverage adversarial reinforcement learning
  for tractable safety analysis under high-dimensional learning dynamics and demonstrate
  our framework’s ability to work with both Bayesian belief propagation and implicit
  learning through large pre-trained neural trajectory predictors.
