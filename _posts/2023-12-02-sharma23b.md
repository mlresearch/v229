title: 'Self-Improving Robots: End-to-End Autonomous Visuomotor Reinforcement Learning'
section: Poster
openreview: ApxLUk8U-l
abstract: 'In imitation and reinforcement learning (RL), the cost of human supervision
  limits the amount of data that the robots can be trained on. While RL offers a framework
  for building self-improving robots that can learn via trial-and-error autonomously,
  practical realizations end up requiring extensive human supervision for reward function
  design and repeated resetting of the environment between episodes of interactions.
  In this work, we propose MEDAL++, a novel design for self-improving robotic systems:
  given a small set of expert demonstrations at the start, the robot autonomously
  practices the task by learning to both do and undo the task, simultaneously inferring
  the reward function from the demonstrations. The policy and reward function are
  learned end-to-end from high-dimensional visual inputs, bypassing the need for explicit
  state estimation or task-specific pre-training for visual encoders used in prior
  work. We first evaluate our proposed system on a simulated non-episodic benchmark
  EARL, finding that MEDAL++ is both more data efficient and gets up to $30%$ better
  final performance compared to state-of-the-art vision-based methods. Our real-robot
  experiments show that MEDAL++ can be applied to manipulation problems in larger
  environments than those considered in prior work, and autonomous self-improvement
  can improve the success rate by $30%$ to $70%$ over behavioral cloning on just the
  expert data.'
