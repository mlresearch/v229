title: Multi-Resolution Sensing for Real-Time Control with Vision-Language Models
section: Poster
openreview: WuBv9-IGDUA
abstract: Leveraging sensing modalities across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions
  can improve performance of robotic manipulation tasks. Multi-spatial resolution
  sensing provides hierarchical information captured at different spatial scales and
  enables both coarse and precise motions. Simultaneously multi-temporal resolution
  sensing enables the agent to exhibit high reactivity and real-time control. In this
  work, we propose a framework for learning generalizable language-conditioned multi-task
  policies that utilize sensing at different spatial and temporal resolutions using
  networks of varying capacities to effectively perform real time control of precise
  and reactive tasks. We leverage off-the-shelf pretrained vision-language models
  to operate on low-frequency global features along with small non-pretrained models
  to adapt to high frequency local feedback. Through extensive experiments in 3 domains
  (coarse, precise and dynamic manipulation tasks), we show that our approach significantly
  improves ($2\times$ on average) over recent multi-task baselines. Further, our approach
  generalizes well to visual and geometric variations in target objects and to varying
  interaction forces.
