title: 'Contrastive Value Learning: Implicit Models for Simple Offline RL'
section: Poster
openreview: oqOfLP6bJy
abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods are appealing in the offline
  setting because they allow an agent to reason about the consequences of actions
  without interacting with the environment. While conventional model-based methods
  learn a 1-step model, predicting the immediate next state, these methods must be
  plugged into larger planning or RL systems to yield a policy. Can we model the environment
  dynamics in a different way, such that the learned model directly indicates the
  value of each action? In this paper, we propose Contrastive Value Learning (CVL),
  which learns an implicit, multi-step dynamics model. This model can be learned without
  access to reward functions, but nonetheless can be used to directly estimate the
  value of each action, without requiring any TD learning. Because this model represents
  the multi-step transitions implicitly, it avoids having to predict high-dimensional
  observations and thus scales to high-dimensional tasks. Our experiments demonstrate
  that CVL outperforms prior offline RL methods on complex robotics benchmarks.
