title: Measuring Interpretability of Neural Policies of Robots with Disentangled Representation
section: Oral
openreview: 6kSohKYYTn0
abstract: The advancement of robots, particularly those functioning in complex human-centric
  environments, relies on control solutions that are driven by machine learning. Understanding
  how learning-based controllers make decisions is crucial since robots are mostly
  safety-critical systems. This urges a formal and quantitative understanding of the
  explanatory factors in the interpretability of robot learning. In this paper, we
  aim to study interpretability of compact neural policies through the lens of disentangled
  representation. We leverage decision trees to obtain factors of variation [1] for
  disentanglement in robot learning; these encapsulate skills, behaviors, or strategies
  toward solving tasks. To assess how well networks uncover the underlying task dynamics,
  we introduce interpretability metrics that measure disentanglement of learned neural
  dynamics from a concentration of decisions, mutual information and modularity perspective.
  We showcase the effectiveness of the connection between interpretability and disentanglement
  consistently across extensive experimental analysis.
