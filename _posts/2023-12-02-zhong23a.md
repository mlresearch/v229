title: Language-Guided Traffic Simulation via Scene-Level Diffusion
section: Oral
openreview: nKWQnYkkwX
abstract: 'Realistic and controllable traffic simulation is a core capability that
  is necessary to accelerate autonomous vehicle (AV) development. However, current
  approaches for controlling learning-based traffic models require significant domain
  expertise and are difficult for practitioners to use. To remedy this, we present
  CTG++, a scene-level conditional diffusion model that can be guided by language
  instructions. Developing this requires tackling two challenges: the need for a realistic
  and controllable traffic model backbone, and an effective method to interface with
  a traffic model using language. To address these challenges, we first propose a
  scene-level diffusion model equipped with a spatio-temporal transformer backbone,
  which generates realistic and controllable traffic. We then harness a large language
  model (LLM) to convert a userâ€™s query into a loss function, guiding the diffusion
  model towards query-compliant generation. Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our proposed method in generating realistic, query-compliant
  traffic simulations.'
