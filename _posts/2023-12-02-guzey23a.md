title: 'Dexterity from Touch: Self-Supervised Pre-Training of Tactile Representations
  with Robotic Play'
section: Poster
openreview: EXQ0eXtX3OW
abstract: Teaching dexterity to multi-fingered robots has been a longstanding challenge
  in robotics. Most prominent work in this area focuses on learning controllers or
  policies that either operate on visual observations or state estimates derived from
  vision. However, such methods perform poorly on fine-grained manipulation tasks
  that require reasoning about contact forces or about objects occluded by the hand
  itself. In this work, we present T-Dex, a new approach for tactile-based dexterity,
  that operates in two phases. In the first phase, we collect 2.5 hours of play data,
  which is used to train self-supervised tactile encoders. This is necessary to bring
  high-dimensional tactile readings to a lower-dimensional embedding. In the second
  phase, given a handful of demonstrations for a dexterous task, we learn non-parametric
  policies that combine the tactile observations with visual ones. Across five challenging
  dexterous tasks, we show that our tactile-based dexterity models outperform purely
  vision and torque-based models by an average of 1.7X. Finally, we provide a detailed
  analysis on factors critical to T-Dex including the importance of play data, architectures,
  and representation learning.
