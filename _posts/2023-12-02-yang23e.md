title: 'LabelFormer: Object Trajectory Refinement for Offboard Perception from LiDAR
  Point Clouds'
section: Poster
openreview: 9cTEQWMo1BF
abstract: A major bottleneck to scaling-up training of self-driving perception systems
  are the human annotations required for supervision. A promising alternative is to
  leverage “auto-labelling" offboard perception models that are trained to automatically
  generate annotations from raw LiDAR point clouds at a fraction of the cost. Auto-labels
  are most commonly generated via a two-stage approach – first objects are detected
  and tracked over time, and then each object trajectory is passed to a learned refinement
  model to improve accuracy. Since existing refinement models are overly complex and
  lack advanced temporal reasoning capabilities, in this work we propose LabelFormer,
  a simple, efficient, and effective trajectory-level refinement approach. Our approach
  first encodes each frame’s observations separately, then exploits self-attention
  to reason about the trajectory with full temporal context, and finally decodes the
  refined object size and per-frame poses. Evaluation on both urban and highway datasets
  demonstrates that LabelFormer outperforms existing works by a large margin. Finally,
  we show that training on a dataset augmented with auto-labels generated by our method
  leads to improved downstream detection performance compared to existing methods.
