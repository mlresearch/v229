title: 'Predicting Object Interactions with Behavior Primitives: An Application in
  Stowing Tasks'
section: Oral
openreview: VH6WIPF4Sj
abstract: Stowing, the task of placing objects in cluttered shelves or bins, is a
  common task in warehouse and manufacturing operations. However, this task is still
  predominantly carried out by human workers as stowing is challenging to automate
  due to the complex multi-object interactions and long-horizon nature of the task.
  Previous works typically involve extensive data collection and costly human labeling
  of semantic priors across diverse object categories. This paper presents a method
  to learn a generalizable robot stowing policy from predictive model of object interactions
  and a single demonstration with behavior primitives. We propose a novel framework
  that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict object interactions within
  the parameter space of behavioral primitives. We further employ primitive-augmented
  trajectory optimization to search the parameters of a predefined library of heterogeneous
  behavioral primitives to instantiate the control action. Our framework enables robots
  to proficiently execute long-horizon stowing tasks with a few keyframes (3-4) from
  a single demonstration. Despite being solely trained in a simulation, our framework
  demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities. It efficiently adapts to a
  broad spectrum of real-world conditions, including various shelf widths, fluctuating
  quantities of objects, and objects with diverse attributes such as sizes and shapes.
