title: Language-Conditioned Path Planning
section: Poster
openreview: 9bK38pUBzU
abstract: Contact is at the core of robotic manipulation. At times, it is desired
  (e.g. manipulation and grasping), and at times, it is harmful (e.g. when avoiding
  obstacles). However, traditional path planning algorithms focus solely on collision-free
  paths, limiting their applicability in contact-rich tasks. To address this limitation,
  we propose the domain of Language-Conditioned Path Planning, where contact-awareness
  is incorporated into the path planning problem. As a first step in this domain,
  we propose Language-Conditioned Collision Functions (LACO), a novel approach that
  learns a collision function using only a single-view image, language prompt, and
  robot configuration. LACO predicts collisions between the robot and the environment,
  enabling flexible, conditional path planning without the need for manual object
  annotations, point cloud data, or ground-truth object meshes. In both simulation
  and the real world, we demonstrate that LACO can facilitate complex, nuanced path
  plans that allow for interaction with objects that are safe to collide, rather than
  prohibiting any collision.
