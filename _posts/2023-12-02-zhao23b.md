title: Learning Human Contribution Preferences in Collaborative Human-Robot Tasks
section: Poster
openreview: 7CtUcT_OHmC
abstract: In human-robot collaboration, both human and robotic agents must work together
  to achieve a set of shared objectives. However, each team member may have individual
  preferences, or constraints, for how they would like to contribute to the task.
  Effective teams align their actions to optimize task performance while satisfying
  each team member’s constraints to the greatest extent possible. We propose a framework
  for representing human and robot contribution constraints in collaborative human-robot
  tasks. Additionally, we present an approach for learning a human partner’s contribution
  constraint online during a collaborative interaction. We evaluate our approach using
  a variety of simulated human partners in a collaborative decluttering task. Our
  results demonstrate that our method improves team performance over baselines with
  some, but not all, simulated human partners. Furthermore, we conducted a pilot user
  study to gather preliminary insights into the effectiveness of our approach on task
  performance and collaborative fluency. Preliminary results suggest that pilot users
  performed fluently with our method, motivating further investigation into considering
  preferences that emerge from collaborative interactions.
