title: Improving Behavioural Cloning with Positive Unlabeled Learning
section: Poster
openreview: 0mRSANSzEK
abstract: 'Learning control policies offline from pre-recorded datasets is a promising
  avenue for solving challenging real-world problems. However, available datasets
  are typically of mixed quality, with a limited number of the trajectories that we
  would consider as positive examples; i.e., high-quality demonstrations. Therefore,
  we propose a novel iterative learning algorithm for identifying expert trajectories
  in unlabeled mixed-quality robotics datasets given a minimal set of positive examples,
  surpassing existing algorithms in terms of accuracy. We show that applying behavioral
  cloning to the resulting filtered dataset outperforms several competitive offline
  reinforcement learning and imitation learning baselines. We perform experiments
  on a range of simulated locomotion tasks and on two challenging manipulation tasks
  on a real robotic system; in these experiments, our method showcases state-of-the-art
  performance. Our website: https://sites.google.com/view/offline-policy-learning-pubc.'
