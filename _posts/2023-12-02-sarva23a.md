section: Poster

abstract: Self-driving vehicles (SDVs) must be rigorously tested on a wide range of
  scenarios to ensure safe deployment. The industry typically relies on closed-loop
  simulation to evaluate how the SDV interacts on a corpus of synthetic and real scenarios
  and to verify good performance. However, they primarily only test the motion planning
  module of the system, and only consider behavior variations. It is key to evaluate
  the full autonomy system in closed-loop, and to understand how variations in sensor
  data based on scene appearance, such as the shape of actors, affect system performance.
  In this paper, we propose a framework, Adv3D, that takes real world scenarios and
  performs closed-loop sensor simulation to evaluate autonomy performance, and finds
  vehicle shapes that make the scenario more challenging, resulting in autonomy failures
  and uncomfortable SDV maneuvers. Unlike prior work that add contrived adversarial
  shapes to vehicle roof-tops or roadside to harm perception performance, we optimize
  a low-dimensional shape representation to modify the vehicle shape itself in a realistic
  manner to degrade full autonomy performance (e.g., perception, prediction, motion
  planning). Moreover, we find that the shape variations found with Adv3D optimized
  in closed-loop are much more effective than open-loop, demonstrating the importance
  of finding and testing scene appearance variations that affect full autonomy performance.
