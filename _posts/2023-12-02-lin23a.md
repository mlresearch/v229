title: Gesture-Informed Robot Assistance via Foundation Models
section: Poster
openreview: Ffn8Z4Q-zU
abstract: 'Gestures serve as a fundamental and significant mode of non-verbal communication
  among humans. Deictic gestures (such as pointing towards an object), in particular,
  offer valuable means of efficiently expressing intent in situations where language
  is inaccessible, restricted, or highly specialized. As a result, it is essential
  for robots to comprehend gestures in order to infer human intentions and establish
  more effective coordination with them. Prior work often rely on a rigid hand-coded
  library of gestures along with their meanings. However, interpretation of gestures
  is often context-dependent, requiring more flexibility and common-sense reasoning.
  In this work, we propose a framework, GIRAF, for more flexibly interpreting gesture
  and language instructions by leveraging the power of large language models. Our
  framework is able to accurately infer human intent and contextualize the meaning
  of their gestures for more effective human-robot collaboration. We instantiate the
  framework for three table-top manipulation tasks and demonstrate that it is both
  effective and preferred by users. We further demonstrate GIRAFâ€™s ability on reasoning
  about diverse types of gestures by curating a GestureInstruct dataset consisting
  of 36 different task scenarios. GIRAF achieved $81%$ success rate on finding the
  correct plan for tasks in GestureInstruct. Videos and datasets can be found on our
