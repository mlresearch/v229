title: A Data-efficient Neural ODE Framework for Optimal Control of Soft Manipulators
section: Poster
openreview: PalhNjBJqv
abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for modeling continuous forward kinematic
  models of soft continuum robots by employing Augmented Neural ODE (ANODE), a cutting-edge
  family of deep neural network models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
  first application of ANODE in modeling soft continuum robots. This formulation introduces
  auxiliary dimensions, allowing the systemâ€™s states to evolve in the augmented space
  which provides a richer set of dynamics that the model can learn, increasing the
  flexibility and accuracy of the model. Our methodology achieves exceptional sample
  efficiency, training the continuous forward kinematic model using only 25 scattered
  data points. Additionally, we design and implement a fully parallel Model Predictive
  Path Integral (MPPI)-based controller running on a GPU, which efficiently manages
  a non-convex objective function. Through a set of experiments, we showed that the
  proposed framework (ANODE+MPPI) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based
  methods such as FNN and RNN in unseen-before scenarios and marginally outperforms
  them in seen-before scenarios.
