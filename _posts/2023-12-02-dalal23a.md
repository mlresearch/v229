title: Imitating Task and Motion Planning with Visuomotor Transformers
section: Poster
openreview: QNPuJZyhFE
abstract: Imitation learning is a powerful tool for training robot manipulation policies,
  allowing them to learn from expert demonstrations without manual programming or
  trial-and-error. However, common methods of data collection, such as human supervision,
  scale poorly, as they are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In contrast, Task
  and Motion Planning (TAMP) can autonomously generate large-scale datasets of diverse
  demonstrations. In this work, we show that the combination of large-scale datasets
  generated by TAMP supervisors and flexible Transformer models to fit them is a powerful
  paradigm for robot manipulation. We present a novel imitation learning system called
  OPTIMUS that trains large-scale visuomotor Transformer policies by imitating a TAMP
  agent. We conduct a thorough study of the design decisions required to imitate TAMP
  and demonstrate that OPTIMUS can solve a wide variety of challenging vision-based
  manipulation tasks with over 70 different objects, ranging from long-horizon pick-and-place
  tasks, to shelf and articulated object manipulation, achieving $70$ to $80%$ success
  rates. Video results and code at https://mihdalal.github.io/optimus/
