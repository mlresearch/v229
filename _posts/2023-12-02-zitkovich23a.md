title: 'RT-2: Vision-Language-Action Models Transfer Web Knowledge to Robotic Control'
section: Poster
openreview: XMQgwiJ7KSX
abstract: 'We study how vision-language models trained on Internet-scale data can
  be incorporated directly into end-to-end robotic control to boost generalization
  and enable emergent semantic reasoning. Our goal is to enable a single end-to-end
  trained model to both learn to map robot observations to actions and enjoy the benefits
  of large-scale pretraining on language and vision-language data from the web. To
  this end, we propose to co-fine-tune state-of-the-art vision-language models on
  both robotic trajectory data and Internet-scale vision-language tasks, such as visual
  question answering. In contrast to other approaches, we propose a simple, general
  recipe to achieve this goal: in order to fit both natural language responses and
  robotic actions into the same format, we express the actions as text tokens and
  incorporate them directly into the training set of the model in the same way as
  natural language tokens. We refer to such category of models as vision-language-action
  models (VLA) and instantiate an example of such a model, which we call RT-2. Our
  extensive evaluation (6k evaluation trials) shows that our approach leads to performant
  robotic policies and enables RT-2 to obtain a range of emergent capabilities from
  Internet-scale training. This includes significantly improved generalization to
  novel objects, the ability to interpret commands not present in the robot training
  data (such as placing an object onto a particular number or icon), and the ability
  to perform rudimentary reasoning in response to user commands (such as picking up
  the smallest or largest object, or the one closest to another object). We further
  show that incorporating chain of thought reasoning allows RT-2 to perform multi-stage
  semantic reasoning, for example figuring out which object to pick up for use as
  an improvised hammer (a rock), or which type of drink is best suited for someone
  who is tired (an energy drink).'
