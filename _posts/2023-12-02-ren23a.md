title: 'Robots That Ask For Help: Uncertainty Alignment for Large Language Model Planners'
section: Oral
openreview: 4ZK8ODNyFXx
abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a wide range of promising capabilities
  — from step-by-step planning to commonsense reasoning — that may provide utility
  for robots, but remain prone to confidently hallucinated predictions. In this work,
  we present KnowNo, a framework for measuring and aligning the uncertainty of LLM-based
  planners, such that they know when they don’t know, and ask for help when needed.
  KnowNo builds on the theory of conformal prediction to provide statistical guarantees
  on task completion while minimizing human help in complex multi-step planning settings.
  Experiments across a variety of simulated and real robot setups that involve tasks
  with different modes of ambiguity (for example, from spatial to numeric uncertainties,
  from human preferences to Winograd schemas) show that KnowNo performs favorably
  over modern baselines (which may involve ensembles or extensive prompt tuning) in
  terms of improving efficiency and autonomy, while providing formal assurances. KnowNo
  can be used with LLMs out-of-the-box without model-finetuning, and suggests a promising
  lightweight approach to modeling uncertainty that can complement and scale with
  the growing capabilities of foundation models.
