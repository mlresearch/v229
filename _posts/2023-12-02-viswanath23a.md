title: 'HANDLOOM: Learned Tracing of One-Dimensional Objects for Inspection and Manipulation'
section: Oral
openreview: WWiKBdcpNd
abstract: Tracing – estimating the spatial state of – long deformable linear objects
  such as cables, threads, hoses, or ropes, is useful for a broad range of tasks in
  homes, retail, factories, construction, transportation, and healthcare. For long
  deformable linear objects (DLOs or simply cables) with many (over 25) crossings,
  we present HANDLOOM (Heterogeneous Autoregressive Learned Deformable Linear Object
  Observation and Manipulation) a learning-based algorithm that fits a trace to a
  greyscale image of cables. We evaluate HANDLOOM on semi-planar DLO configurations
  where each crossing involves at most 2 segments. HANDLOOM makes use of neural networks
  trained with 30,000 simulated examples and 568 real examples to autoregressively
  estimate traces of cables and classify crossings. Experiments find that in settings
  with multiple identical cables, HANDLOOM can trace each cable with $80%$ accuracy.
  In single-cable images, HANDLOOM can trace and identify knots with $77%$ accuracy.
  When HANDLOOM is incorporated into a bimanual robot system, it enables state-based
  imitation of knot tying with $80%$ accuracy, and it successfully untangles $64%$
  of cable configurations across 3 levels of difficulty. Additionally, HANDLOOM demonstrates
  generalization to knot types and materials (rubber, cloth rope) not present in the
  training dataset with $85%$ accuracy. Supplementary material, including all code
  and an annotated dataset of RGB-D images of cables along with ground-truth traces,
  is at https://sites.google.com/view/cable-tracing.
