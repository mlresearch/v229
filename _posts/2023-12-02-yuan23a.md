title: 'M2T2: Multi-Task Masked Transformer for Object-centric Pick and Place'
section: Poster
openreview: 6zGpfOBImD
abstract: With the advent of large language models and large-scale robotic datasets,
  there has been tremendous progress in high-level decision-making for object manipulation.
  These generic models are able to interpret complex tasks using language commands,
  but they often have difficulties generalizing to out-of-distribution objects due
  to the inability of low-level action primitives. In contrast, existing task-specific
  models excel in low-level manipulation of unknown objects, but only work for a single
  type of action. To bridge this gap, we present M2T2, a single model that supplies
  different types of low-level actions that work robustly on arbitrary objects in
  cluttered scenes. M2T2 is a transformer model which reasons about contact points
  and predicts valid gripper poses for different action modes given a raw point cloud
  of the scene. Trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset with 128K scenes, M2T2
  achieves zero-shot sim2real transfer on the real robot, outperforming the baseline
  system with state-of-the-art task-specific models by about $19%$ in overall performance
  and $37.5%$ in challenging scenes were the object needs to be re-oriented for collision-free
  placement. M2T2 also achieves state-of-the-art results on a subset of language conditioned
  tasks in RLBench. Videos of robot experiments on unseen objects in both real world
  and simulation are available at m2-t2.github.io.
