title: Compositional Diffusion-Based Continuous Constraint Solvers
section: Poster
openreview: BimpCf1rT7
abstract: This paper introduces an approach for learning to solve continuous constraint
  satisfaction problems (CCSP) in robotic reasoning and planning. Previous methods
  primarily rely on hand-engineering or learning generators for specific constraint
  types and then rejecting the value assignments when other constraints are violated.
  By contrast, our model, the compositional diffusion continuous constraint solver
  (Diffusion-CCSP) derives global solutions to CCSPs by representing them as factor
  graphs and combining the energies of diffusion models trained to sample for individual
  constraint types. Diffusion-CCSP exhibits strong generalization to novel combinations
  of known constraints, and it can be integrated into a task and motion planner to
  devise long-horizon plans that include actions with both discrete and continuous
  parameters.
