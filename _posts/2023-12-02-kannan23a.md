title: 'DEFT: Dexterous Fine-Tuning for Hand Policies'
section: Poster
openreview: wH23nZpVTF6
abstract: Dexterity is often seen as a cornerstone of complex manipulation. Humans
  are able to perform a host of skills with their hands, from making food to operating
  tools. In this paper, we investigate these challenges, especially in the case of
  soft, deformable objects as well as complex, relatively long-horizon tasks. Although,
  learning such behaviors from scratch can be data inefficient. To circumvent this,
  we propose a novel approach, DEFT (DExterous Fine-Tuning for Hand Policies), that
  leverages human-driven priors, which are executed directly in the real world. In
  order to improve upon these priors, DEFT involves an efficient online optimization
  procedure. With the integration of human-based learning and online fine-tuning,
  coupled with a soft robotic hand, DEFT demonstrates success across various tasks,
  establishing a robust, data-efficient pathway toward general dexterous manipulation.
