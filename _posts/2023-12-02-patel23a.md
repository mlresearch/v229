title: Predicting Routine Object Usage for Proactive Robot Assistance
section: Poster
openreview: rvh0vkwKUM
abstract: Proactivity in robot assistance refers to the robot’s ability to anticipate
  user needs and perform assistive actions without explicit requests. This requires
  understanding user routines, predicting consistent activities, and actively seeking
  information to predict inconsistent behaviors. We propose SLaTe-PRO (Sequential
  Latent Temporal model for Predicting Routine Object usage), which improves upon
  prior state-of-the-art by combining object and user action information, and conditioning
  object usage predictions on past history. Additionally, we find some human behavior
  to be inherently stochastic and lacking in contextual cues that the robot can use
  for proactive assistance. To address such cases, we introduce an interactive query
  mechanism that can be used to ask queries about the user’s intended activities and
  object use to improve prediction. We evaluate our approach on longitudinal data
  from three households, spanning 24 activity classes. SLaTe-PRO performance raises
  the F1 score metric to 0.57 without queries, and 0.60 with user queries, over a
  score of 0.43 from prior work. We additionally present a case study with a fully
  autonomous household robot.
