title: 'SCALE: Causal Learning and Discovery of Robot Manipulation Skills using Simulation'
section: Poster
openreview: WmF-fagWdD
abstract: 'We propose SCALE, an approach for discovering and learning a diverse set
  of interpretable robot skills from a limited dataset. Rather than learning a single
  skill which may fail to capture all the modes in the data, we first identify the
  different modes via causal reasoning and learn a separate skill for each of them.
  Our main insight is to associate each mode with a unique set of causally relevant
  context variables that are discovered by performing causal interventions in simulation.
  This enables data partitioning based on the causal processes that generated the
  data, and then compressed skills that ignore the irrelevant variables can be trained.
  We model each robot skill as a Regional Compressed Option, which extends the options
  framework by associating a causal process and its relevant variables with the option.
  Modeled as the skill Data Generating Region, each causal process is local in nature
  and hence valid over only a subset of the context space. We demonstrate our approach
  for two representative manipulation tasks: block stacking and peg-in-hole insertion
  under uncertainty. Our experiments show that our approach yields diverse skills
  that are compact, robust to domain shifts, and suitable for sim-to-real transfer.'
