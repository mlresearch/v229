title: 'MimicPlay: Long-Horizon Imitation Learning by Watching Human Play'
section: Oral
openreview: hRZ1YjDZmTo
abstract: Imitation learning from human demonstrations is a promising paradigm for
  teaching robots manipulation skills in the real world. However, learning complex
  long-horizon tasks often requires an unattainable amount of demonstrations. To reduce
  the high data requirement, we resort to human play data - video sequences of people
  freely interacting with the environment using their hands. Even with different morphologies,
  we hypothesize that human play data contain rich and salient information about physical
  interactions that can readily facilitate robot policy learning. Motivated by this,
  we introduce a hierarchical learning framework named MimicPlay that learns latent
  plans from human play data to guide low-level visuomotor control trained on a small
  number of teleoperated demonstrations. With systematic evaluations of 14 long-horizon
  manipulation tasks in the real world, we show that MimicPlay outperforms state-of-the-art
  imitation learning methods in task success rate, generalization ability, and robustness
  to disturbances. Code and videos are available at https://mimic-play.github.io.
