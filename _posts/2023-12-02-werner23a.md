  Learning in Simulation'

abstract: 'Autonomous racing is a challenging task that requires vehicle handling
  at the dynamic limits of friction. While single-agent scenarios like Time Trials
  are solved competitively with classical model-based or model-free feedback control,
  multi-agent wheel-to-wheel racing poses several challenges including planning over
  unknown opponent intentions as well as negotiating interactions under dynamic constraints.
  We propose to address these challenges via a learning-based approach that effectively
  combines model-based techniques, massively parallel simulation, and self-play reinforcement
  learning to enable zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of highly dynamic policies. We
  deploy our algorithm in wheel-to-wheel multi-agent races on scale hardware to demonstrate
  the efficacy of our approach. Further details and videos can be found on the project
