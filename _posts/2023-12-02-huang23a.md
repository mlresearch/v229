title: 'DATT: Deep Adaptive Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotor Control'
section: Oral
openreview: XEw-cnNsr6
abstract: Precise arbitrary trajectory tracking for quadrotors is challenging due
  to unknown nonlinear dynamics, trajectory infeasibility, and actuation limits. To
  tackle these challenges, we present DATT, a learning-based approach that can precisely
  track arbitrary, potentially infeasible trajectories in the presence of large disturbances
  in the real world. DATT builds on a novel feedforward-feedback-adaptive control
  structure trained in simulation using reinforcement learning. When deployed on real
  hardware, DATT is augmented with a disturbance estimator using $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive
  control in closed-loop, without any fine-tuning. DATT significantly outperforms
  competitive adaptive nonlinear and model predictive controllers for both feasible
  smooth and infeasible trajectories in unsteady wind fields, including challenging
  scenarios where baselines completely fail. Moreover, DATT can efficiently run online
  with an inference time less than 3.2ms, less than 1/4 of the adaptive nonlinear
  model predictive control baseline.
