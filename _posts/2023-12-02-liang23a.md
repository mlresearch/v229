title: Context-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Robotic Navigation
  in Unknown Area
section: Poster
openreview: kSXh83gWWy
abstract: Mapless navigation refers to a challenging task where a mobile robot must
  rapidly navigate to a predefined destination using its partial knowledge of the
  environment, which is updated online along the way, instead of a prior map of the
  environment. Inspired by the recent developments in deep reinforcement learning
  (DRL), we propose a learning-based framework for mapless navigation, which employs
  a context-aware policy network to achieve efficient decision-making (i.e., maximize
  the likelihood of finding the shortest route towards the target destination), especially
  in complex and large-scale environments. Specifically, our robot learns to form
  a context of its belief over the entire known area, which it uses to reason about
  long-term efficiency and sequence show-term movements. Additionally, we propose
  a graph rarefaction algorithm to enable more efficient decision-making in large-scale
  applications. We empirically demonstrate that our approach reduces average travel
  time by up to $61.4%$ and average planning time by up to $88.2%$ compared to benchmark
  planners (D*lite and BIT) on hundreds of test scenarios. We also validate our approach
  both in high-fidelity Gazebo simulations as well as on hardware, highlighting its
  promising applicability in the real world without further training/tuning.
