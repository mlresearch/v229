  Robot Experience'
section: Poster

abstract: Terrain awareness, i.e., the ability to identify and distinguish different
  types of terrain, is a critical ability that robots must have to succeed at autonomous
  off-road navigation. Current approaches that provide robots with this awareness
  either rely on labeled data which is expensive to collect, engineered features and
  cost functions that may not generalize, or expert human demonstrations which may
  not be available. Towards endowing robots with terrain awareness without these limitations,
  we introduce Self-supervised TErrain Representation LearnING (STERLING), a novel
  approach for learning terrain representations that relies solely on easy-to-collect,
  unconstrained (e.g., non-expert), and unlabelled robot experience, with no additional
  constraints on data collection. STERLING employs a novel multi-modal self-supervision
  objective through non-contrastive representation learning to learn relevant terrain
  representations for terrain-aware navigation. Through physical robot experiments
  in off-road environments, we evaluate STERLING features on the task of preference-aligned
  visual navigation and find that STERLING features perform on par with fully-supervised
  approaches and outperform other state-of-the-art methods with respect to preference
  alignment. Additionally, we perform a large-scale experiment of autonomously hiking
  a 3-mile long trail which STERLING completes successfully with only two manual interventions,
  demonstrating its robustness to real-world off-road conditions.
