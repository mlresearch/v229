title: Neural Graph Control Barrier Functions Guided Distributed Collision-avoidance
  Multi-agent Control
section: Poster
openreview: VscdYkKgwdH
abstract: We consider the problem of designing distributed collision-avoidance multi-agent
  control in large-scale environments with potentially moving obstacles, where a large
  number of agents are required to maintain safety using only local information and
  reach their goals. This paper addresses the problem of collision avoidance, scalability,
  and generalizability by introducing graph control barrier functions (GCBFs) for
  distributed control. The newly introduced GCBF is based on the well-established
  CBF theory for safety guarantees but utilizes a graph structure for scalable and
  generalizable decentralized control. We use graph neural networks to learn both
  neural a GCBF certificate and distributed control. We also extend the framework
  from handling state-based models to directly taking point clouds from LiDAR for
  more practical robotics settings. We demonstrated the efficacy of GCBF in a variety
  of numerical experiments, where the number, density, and traveling distance of agents,
  as well as the number of unseen and uncontrolled obstacles increase. Empirical results
  show that GCBF outperforms leading methods such as MAPPO and multi-agent distributed
  CBF (MDCBF). Trained with only $16$ agents, GCBF can achieve up to $3$ times improvement
  of success rate (agents reach goals and never encountered in any collisions) on
  $<500$ agents, and still maintain more than $50%$ success rates for $>\!1000$ agents
  when other methods completely fail.
