title: Language Conditioned Traffic Generation
section: Poster
openreview: PK2debCKaG
abstract: 'Simulation forms the backbone of modern self-driving development. Simulators
  help develop, test, and improve driving systems without putting humans, vehicles,
  or their environment at risk. However, simulators face a major challenge: They rely
  on realistic, scalable, yet interesting content. While recent advances in rendering
  and scene reconstruction make great strides in creating static scene assets, modeling
  their layout, dynamics, and behaviors remains challenging. In this work, we turn
  to language as a source of supervision for dynamic traffic scene generation. Our
  model, LCTGen, combines a large language model with a transformer-based decoder
  architecture that selects likely map locations from a dataset of maps, and produces
  an initial traffic distribution, as well as the dynamics of each vehicle. LCTGen
  outperforms prior work in both unconditional and conditional traffic scene generation
  in terms of realism and fidelity.'
