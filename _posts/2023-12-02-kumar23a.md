title: Learning Efficient Abstract Planning Models that Choose What to Predict
section: Poster
openreview: _gZLyRGGuo
abstract: An effective approach to solving long-horizon tasks in robotics domains
  with continuous state and action spaces is bilevel planning, wherein a high-level
  search over an abstraction of an environment is used to guide low-level decision-making.
  Recent work has shown how to enable such bilevel planning by learning abstract models
  in the form of symbolic operators and neural samplers. In this work, we show that
  existing symbolic operator learning approaches fall short in many robotics domains
  where a robot’s actions tend to cause a large number of irrelevant changes in the
  abstract state. This is primarily because they attempt to learn operators that exactly
  predict all observed changes in the abstract state. To overcome this issue, we propose
  to learn operators that ‘choose what to predict’ by only modelling changes necessary
  for abstract planning to achieve specified goals. Experimentally, we show that our
  approach learns operators that lead to efficient planning across 10 different hybrid
  robotics domains, including 4 from the challenging BEHAVIOR-100 benchmark, while
  generalizing to novel initial states, goals, and objects.
