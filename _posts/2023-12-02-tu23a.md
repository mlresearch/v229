title: Towards Scalable Coverage-Based Testing of Autonomous Vehicles
section: Poster
openreview: Q9ezhChqnL
abstract: To deploy autonomous vehicles(AVs) in the real world, developers must understand
  the conditions in which the system can operate safely. To do this in a scalable
  manner, AVs are often tested in simulation on parameterized scenarios. In this context,
  it’s important to build a testing framework that partitions the scenario parameter
  space into safe, unsafe, and unknown regions. Existing approaches rely on discretizing
  continuous parameter spaces into bins, which scales poorly to high-dimensional spaces
  and cannot describe regions with arbitrary shape. In this work, we introduce a problem
  formulation which avoids discretization – by modeling the probability of meeting
  safety requirements everywhere, the parameter space can be paritioned using a probability
  threshold. Based on our formulation, we propose GUARD as a testing framework which
  leverages Gaussian Processes to model probability and levelset algorithms to efficiently
  generate tests. Moreover, we introduce a set of novel evaluation metrics for coverage-based
  testing frameworks to capture the key objectives of testing. In our evaluation suite
  of diverse high-dimensional scenarios, GUARD significantly outperforms existing
  approaches. By proposing an efficient, accurate, and scalable testing framework,
  our work is a step towards safely deploying autonomous vehicles at scale.
