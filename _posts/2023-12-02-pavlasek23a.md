title: Ready, Set, Plan! Planning to Goal Sets Using Generalized Bayesian Inference
section: Poster
openreview: 5JMGq83yf1N
abstract: Many robotic tasks can have multiple and diverse solutions and, as such,
  are naturally expressed as goal sets. Examples include navigating to a room, finding
  a feasible placement location for an object, or opening a drawer enough to reach
  inside. Using a goal set as a planning objective requires that a model for the objective
  be explicitly given by the user. However, some goals are intractable to model, leading
  to uncertainty over the goal (e.g. stable grasping of an object). In this work,
  we propose a technique for planning directly to a set of sampled goal configurations.
  We formulate a planning as inference problem with a novel goal likelihood evaluated
  against the goal samples. To handle the intractable goal likelihood, we employ Generalized
  Bayesian Inference to approximate the trajectory distribution. The result is a fully
  differentiable cost which generalizes across a diverse range of goal set objectives
  for which samples can be obtained. We show that by considering all goal samples
  throughout the planning process, our method reliably finds plans on manipulation
  and navigation problems where heuristic approaches fail.
