title: Online Learning for Obstacle Avoidance
section: Poster
openreview: HYka22IcV6
abstract: We approach the fundamental problem of obstacle avoidance for robotic systems
  via the lens of online learning. In contrast to prior work that either assumes worst-case
  realizations of uncertainty in the environment or a stationary stochastic model
  of uncertainty, we propose a method that is efficient to implement and provably
  grants instance-optimality with respect to perturbations of trajectories generated
  from an open-loop planner (in the sense of minimizing worst-case regret). The resulting
  policy adapts online to realizations of uncertainty and provably compares well with
  the best obstacle avoidance policy in hindsight from a rich class of policies. The
  method is validated in simulation on a dynamical system environment and compared
  to baseline open-loop planning and robust Hamilton-Jacobi reachability techniques.
  Further, it is implemented on a hardware example where a quadruped robot traverses
  a dense obstacle field and encounters input disturbances due to time delays, model
  uncertainty, and dynamics nonlinearities.
