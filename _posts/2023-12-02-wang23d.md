title: A Policy Optimization Method Towards Optimal-time Stability
section: Poster
openreview: rOCWUmMBSnH
abstract: In current model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, stability
  criteria based on sampling methods are commonly utilized to guide policy optimization.
  However, these criteria only guarantee the infinite-time convergence of the system’s
  state to an equilibrium point, which leads to sub-optimality of the policy. In this
  paper, we propose a policy optimization technique incorporating sampling-based Lyapunov
  stability. Our approach enables the system’s state to reach an equilibrium point
  within an optimal time and maintain stability thereafter, referred to as "optimal-time
  stability". To achieve this, we integrate the optimization method into the Actor-Critic
  framework, resulting in the development of the Adaptive Lyapunov-based Actor-Critic
  (ALAC) algorithm. Through evaluations conducted on ten robotic tasks, our approach
  outperforms previous studies significantly, effectively guiding the system to generate
  stable patterns.
