title: 'Navigation with Large Language Models: Semantic Guesswork as a Heuristic for
  Planning'
section: Poster
openreview: PsV65r0itpo
abstract: 'Navigation in unfamiliar environments presents a major challenge for robots:
  while mapping and planning techniques can be used to build up a representation of
  the world, quickly discovering a path to a desired goal in unfamiliar settings with
  such methods often requires lengthy mapping and exploration. Humans can rapidly
  navigate new environments, particularly indoor environments that are laid out logically,
  by leveraging semantics — e.g., a kitchen often adjoins a living room, an exit sign
  indicates the way out, and so forth. Language models can provide robots with such
  knowledge, but directly using language models to instruct a robot how to reach some
  destination can also be impractical: while language models might produce a narrative
  about how to reach some goal, because they are not grounded in real-world observations,
  this narrative might be arbitrarily wrong. Therefore, in this paper we study how
  the “semantic guesswork” produced by language models can be utilized as a guiding
  heuristic for planning algorithms. Our method, Language Frontier Guide (LFG), uses
  the language model to bias exploration of novel real-world environments by incorporating
  the semantic knowledge stored in language models as a search heuristic for planning
  with either topological or metric maps. We evaluate LFG in challenging real-world
  environments and simulated benchmarks, outperforming uninformed exploration and
  other ways of using language models.'
