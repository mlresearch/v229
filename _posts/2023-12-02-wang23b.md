title: 'PreCo: Enhancing Generalization in Co-Design of Modular Soft Robots via Brain-Body
  Pre-Training'
section: Oral
openreview: E2vL12SwO1
abstract: Brain-body co-design, which involves the collaborative design of control
  strategies and morphologies, has emerged as a promising approach to enhance a robotâ€™s
  adaptability to its environment. However, the conventional co-design process often
  starts from scratch, lacking the utilization of prior knowledge. This can result
  in time-consuming and costly endeavors. In this paper, we present PreCo, a novel
  methodology that efficiently integrates brain-body pre-training into the co-design
  process of modular soft robots. PreCo is based on the insight of embedding co-design
  principles into models, achieved by pre-training a universal co-design policy on
  a diverse set of tasks. This pre-trained co-designer is utilized to generate initial
  designs and control policies, which are then fine-tuned for specific co-design tasks.
  Through experiments on a modular soft robot system, our method demonstrates zero-shot
  generalization to unseen co-design tasks, facilitating few-shot adaptation while
  significantly reducing the number of policy iterations required.
