title: 'PolarNet: 3D Point Clouds for Language-Guided Robotic Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: efaE7iJ2GJv
abstract: The ability for robots to comprehend and execute manipulation tasks based
  on natural language instructions is a long-term goal in robotics. The dominant approaches
  for language-guided manipulation use 2D image representations, which face difficulties
  in combining multi-view cameras and inferring precise 3D positions and relationships.
  To address these limitations, we propose a 3D point cloud based policy called PolarNet
  for language-guided manipulation. It leverages carefully designed point cloud inputs,
  efficient point cloud encoders, and multimodal transformers to learn 3D point cloud
  representations and integrate them with language instructions for action prediction.
  PolarNet is shown to be effective and data efficient in a variety of experiments
  conducted on the RLBench benchmark. It outperforms state-of-the-art 2D and 3D approaches
  in both single-task and multi-task learning. It also achieves promising results
  on a real robot.
