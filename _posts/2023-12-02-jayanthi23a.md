title: 'DROID: Learning from Offline Heterogeneous Demonstrations via Reward-Policy
  Distillation'
section: Poster
openreview: h-geaPzuJu
abstract: 'Offline Learning from Demonstrations (OLfD) is valuable in domains where
  trial-and-error learning is infeasible or specifying a cost function is difficult,
  such as robotic surgery, autonomous driving, and path-finding for NASA’s Mars rovers.
  However, two key problems remain challenging in OLfD: 1) heterogeneity: demonstration
  data can be generated with diverse preferences and strategies, and 2) generalizability:
  the learned policy and reward must perform well beyond a limited training regime
  in unseen test settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose Dual Reward and
  policy Offline Inverse Distillation (DROID), where the key idea is to leverage diversity
  to improve generalization performance by decomposing common-task and individual-specific
  strategies and distilling knowledge in both the reward and policy spaces. We ground
  DROID in a novel and uniquely challenging Mars rover path-planning problem for NASA’s
  Mars Curiosity Rover. We also curate a novel dataset along 163 Sols (Martian days)
  and conduct a novel, empirical investigation to characterize heterogeneity in the
  dataset. We find DROID outperforms prior SOTA OLfD techniques, leading to a $26%$
  improvement in modeling expert behaviors and $92%$ closer to the task objective
  of reaching the final destination. We also benchmark DROID on the OpenAI Gym Cartpole
  environment and find DROID achieves $55%$ (significantly) better performance modeling
  heterogeneous demonstrations.'
