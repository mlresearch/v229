title: Learning Robot Manipulation from Cross-Morphology Demonstration
section: Poster
openreview: WGSR7HDuHu
abstract: Some Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) methods handle small mismatches
  in the action spaces of the teacher and student. Here we address the casewhere the
  teacherâ€™s morphology is substantially different from that of the student. Our framework,
  Morphological Adaptation in Imitation Learning (MAIL), bridges this gap allowing
  us to train an agent from demonstrations by other agents with significantly different
  morphologies. MAIL learns from suboptimal demonstrations, so long as they provide
  some guidance towards a desired solution. We demonstrate MAIL on manipulation tasks
  with rigid and deformable objects including 3D cloth manipulation interacting with
  rigid obstacles. We train a visual control policy for a robot with one end-effector
  using demonstrations from a simulated agent with two end-effectors. MAIL shows up
  to $24%$ improvement in a normalized performance metric over LfD and non-LfD baselines.
  It is deployed to a real Franka Panda robot, handles multiple variations in properties
  for objects (size, rotation, translation), and cloth-specific properties (color,
  thickness, size, material).
