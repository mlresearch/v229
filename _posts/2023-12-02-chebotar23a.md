title: 'Q-Transformer: Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning via Autoregressive
  Q-Functions'
section: Poster
openreview: 0I3su3mkuL
abstract: In this work, we present a scalable reinforcement learning method for training
  multi-task policies from large offline datasets that can leverage both human demonstrations
  and autonomously collected data. Our method uses a Transformer to provide a scalable
  representation for Q-functions trained via offline temporal difference backups.
  We therefore refer to the method as Q-Transformer. By discretizing each action dimension
  and representing the Q-value of each action dimension as separate tokens, we can
  apply effective high-capacity sequence modeling techniques for Q-learning. We present
  several design decisions that enable good performance with offline RL training,
  and show that Q-Transformer outperforms prior offline RL algorithms and imitation
  learning techniques on a large diverse real-world robotic manipulation task suite.
