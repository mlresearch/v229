title: 'HOI4ABOT: Human-Object Interaction Anticipation for Human Intention Reading
  Collaborative roBOTs'
section: Poster

abstract: Robots are becoming increasingly integrated into our lives, assisting us
  in various tasks. To ensure effective collaboration between humans and robots, it
  is essential that they understand our intentions and anticipate our actions. In
  this paper, we propose a Human-Object Interaction (HOI) anticipation framework for
  collaborative robots. We propose an efficient and robust transformer-based model
  to detect and anticipate HOIs from videos. This enhanced anticipation empowers robots
  to proactively assist humans, resulting in more efficient and intuitive collaborations.
  Our model outperforms state-of-the-art results in HOI detection and anticipation
  in VidHOI dataset with an increase of $1.76%$ and $1.04%$ in mAP respectively while
  being 15.4 times faster. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach through experimental
  results in a real robot, demonstrating that the robotâ€™s ability to anticipate HOIs
  is key for better Human-Robot Interaction.
