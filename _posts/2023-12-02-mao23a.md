title: Learning Reusable Manipulation Strategies
section: Poster
openreview: ihqTtzS83VS
abstract: Humans demonstrate an impressive ability to acquire and generalize manipulation
  “tricks.” Even from a single demonstration, such as using soup ladles to reach for
  distant objects, we can apply this skill to new scenarios involving different object
  positions, sizes, and categories (e.g., forks and hammers). Additionally, we can
  flexibly combine various skills to devise long-term plans. In this paper, we present
  a framework that enables machines to acquire such manipulation skills, referred
  to as “mechanisms,” through a single demonstration and self-play. Our key insight
  lies in interpreting each demonstration as a sequence of changes in robot-object
  and object-object contact modes, which provides a scaffold for learning detailed
  samplers for continuous parameters. These learned mechanisms and samplers can be
  seamlessly integrated into standard task and motion planners, enabling their compositional
  use.
