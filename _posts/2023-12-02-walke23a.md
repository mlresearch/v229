title: 'BridgeData V2: A Dataset for Robot Learning at Scale'
section: Poster
openreview: f55MlAT1Lu
abstract: We introduce BridgeData V2, a large and diverse dataset of robotic manipulation
  behaviors designed to facilitate research in scalable robot learning. BridgeData
  V2 contains 53,896 trajectories collected across 24 environments on a publicly available
  low-cost robot. Unlike many existing robotic manipulation datasets, BridgeData V2
  provides enough task and environment variability that skills learned from the data
  generalize across institutions, making the dataset a useful resource for a broad
  range of researchers. Additionally, the dataset is compatible with a wide variety
  of open-vocabulary, multi-task learning methods conditioned on goal images or natural
  language instructions. In our experiments,we apply 6 state-of-the-art imitation
  learning and offline reinforcement learning methods to the data and find that they
  succeed on a suite of tasks requiring varying amounts of generalization. We also
  demonstrate that the performance of these methods improves with more data and higher
  capacity models. By publicly sharing BridgeData V2 and our pre-trained models, we
  aim to accelerate research in scalable robot learning methods.
