title: 'Policy Stitching: Learning Transferable Robot Policies'
section: Poster
openreview: 2qKBwyLnln
abstract: Training robots with reinforcement learning (RL) typically involves heavy
  interactions with the environment, and the acquired skills are often sensitive to
  changes in task environments and robot kinematics. Transfer RL aims to leverage
  previous knowledge to accelerate learning of new tasks or new body configurations.
  However, existing methods struggle to generalize to novel robot-task combinations
  and scale to realistic tasks due to complex architecture design or strong regularization
  that limits the capacity of the learned policy. We propose Policy Stitching, a novel
  framework that facilitates robot transfer learning for novel combinations of robots
  and tasks. Our key idea is to apply modular policy design and align the latent representations
  between the modular interfaces. Our method allows direct stitching of the robot
  and task modules trained separately to form a new policy for fast adaptation. Our
  simulated and real-world experiments on various 3D manipulation tasks demonstrate
  the superior zero-shot and few-shot transfer learning performances of our method.
