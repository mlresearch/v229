title: 'DYNAMO-GRASP: DYNAMics-aware Optimization for GRASP Point Detection in Suction
  Grippers'
section: Poster
openreview: _DYsYC9smK
abstract: 'In this research, we introduce a novel approach to the challenge of suction
  grasp point detection. Our method, exploiting the strengths of physics-based simulation
  and data-driven modeling, accounts for object dynamics during the grasping process,
  markedly enhancing the robotâ€™s capability to handle previously unseen objects and
  scenarios in real-world settings. We benchmark DYNAMO-GRASP against established
  approaches via comprehensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments.
  DYNAMO-GRASP delivers improved grasping performance with greater consistency in
  both simulated and real-world settings. Remarkably, in real-world tests with challenging
  scenarios, our method demonstrates a success rate improvement of up to $48%$ over
  SOTA methods. Demonstrating a strong ability to adapt to complex and unexpected
  object dynamics, our method offers robust generalization to real-world challenges.
  The results of this research set the stage for more reliable and resilient robotic
  manipulation in intricate real-world situations. Experiment videos, dataset, model,
