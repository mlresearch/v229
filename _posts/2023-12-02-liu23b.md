title: Learning to Design and Use Tools for Robotic Manipulation
section: Poster
openreview: xgrZkRHliXR
abstract: When limited by their own morphologies, humans and some species of animals
  have the remarkable ability to use objects from the environment toward accomplishing
  otherwise impossible tasks. Robots might similarly unlock a range of additional
  capabilities through tool use. Recent techniques for jointly optimizing morphology
  and control via deep learning are effective at designing locomotion agents. But
  while outputting a single morphology makes sense for locomotion, manipulation involves
  a variety of strategies depending on the task goals at hand. A manipulation agent
  must be capable of rapidly prototyping specialized tools for different goals. Therefore,
  we propose learning a designer policy, rather than a single design. A designer policy
  is conditioned on task information and outputs a tool design that helps solve the
  task. A design-conditioned controller policy can then perform manipulation using
  these tools. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by introducing a reinforcement
  learning framework for jointly learning these policies. Through simulated manipulation
  tasks, we show that this framework is more sample efficient than prior methods in
  multi-goal or multi-variant settings, can perform zero-shot interpolation or fine-tuning
  to tackle previously unseen goals, and allows tradeoffs between the complexity of
  design and control policies under practical constraints. Finally, we deploy our
  learned policies onto a real robot. Please see our supplementary video and website
