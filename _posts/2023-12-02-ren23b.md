title: 'AdaptSim: Task-Driven Simulation Adaptation for Sim-to-Real Transfer'
section: Poster
openreview: 9GRE34K0SB
abstract: 'Simulation parameter settings such as contact models and object geometry
  approximations are critical to training robust manipulation policies capable of
  transferring from simulation to real-world deployment. There is often an irreducible
  gap between simulation and reality: attempting to match the dynamics between simulation
  and reality may be infeasible and may not lead to policies that perform well in
  reality for a specific task. We propose AdaptSim, a new task-driven adaptation framework
  for sim-to-real transfer that aims to optimize task performance in target (real)
  environments. First, we meta-learn an adaptation policy in simulation using reinforcement
  learning for adjusting the simulation parameter distribution based on the current
  policyâ€™s performance in a target environment. We then perform iterative real-world
  adaptation by inferring new simulation parameter distributions for policy training.
  Our extensive simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate AdaptSim achieving
  1-3x asymptotic performance and 2x real data efficiency when adapting to different
  environments, compared to methods based on Sys-ID and directly training the task
  policy in target environments.'
