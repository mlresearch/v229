title: 'OVIR-3D: Open-Vocabulary 3D Instance Retrieval Without Training on 3D Data'
section: Poster
openreview: gVBvtRqU1_
abstract: This work presents OVIR-3D, a straightforward yet effective method for open-vocabulary
  3D object instance retrieval without using any 3D data for training. Given a language
  query, the proposed method is able to return a ranked set of 3D object instance
  segments based on the feature similarity of the instance and the text query. This
  is achieved by a multi-view fusion of text-aligned 2D region proposals into 3D space,
  where the 2D region proposal network could leverage 2D datasets, which are more
  accessible and typically larger than 3D datasets. The proposed fusion process is
  efficient as it can be performed in real-time for most indoor 3D scenes and does
  not require additional training in 3D space. Experiments on public datasets and
  a real robot show the effectiveness of the method and its potential for applications
  in robot navigation and manipulation.
