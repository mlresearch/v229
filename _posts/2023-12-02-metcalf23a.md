title: Sample-Efficient Preference-based Reinforcement Learning with Dynamics Aware
  Rewards
section: Poster
openreview: i84V7i6KEMd
abstract: 'Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) aligns a robot behavior
  with human preferences via a reward function learned from binary feedback over agent
  behaviors. We show that encoding environment dynamics in the reward function improves
  the sample efficiency of PbRL by an order of magnitude. In our experiments we iterate
  between: (1) encoding environment dynamics in a state-action representation $z^{sa}$
  via a self-supervised temporal consistency task, and (2) bootstrapping the preference-based
  reward function from $z^{sa}$, which results in faster policy learning and better
  final policy performance. For example, on quadruped-walk, walker-walk, and cheetah-run,
  with 50 preference labels we achieve the same performance as existing approaches
  with 500 preference labels, and we recover $83%$ and $66%$ of ground truth reward
  policy performance versus only $38%$ and $21%$ without environment dynamics. The
  performance gains demonstrate that explicitly encoding environment dynamics improves
  preference-learned reward functions.'
