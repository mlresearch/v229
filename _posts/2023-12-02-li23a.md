title: Rearrangement Planning for General Part Assembly
section: Oral
openreview: pLCQkMojXI
abstract: Most successes in autonomous robotic assembly have been restricted to single
  target or category. We propose to investigate general part assembly, the task of
  creating novel target assemblies with unseen part shapes. As a fundamental step
  to a general part assembly system, we tackle the task of determining the precise
  poses of the parts in the target assembly, which we term “rearrangement planning".
  We present General Part Assembly Transformer (GPAT), a transformer-based model architecture
  that accurately predicts part poses by inferring how each part shape corresponds
  to the target shape. Our experiments on both 3D CAD models and real-world scans
  demonstrate GPAT’s generalization abilities to novel and diverse target and part
  shapes.
