title: 'Im2Contact: Vision-Based Contact Localization Without Touch or Force Sensing'
section: Poster
openreview: h8halpbqB-
abstract: 'Contacts play a critical role in most manipulation tasks. Robots today
  mainly use proximal touch/force sensors to sense contacts, but the information they
  provide must be calibrated and is inherently local, with practical applications
  relying either on extensive surface coverage or restrictive assumptions to resolve
  ambiguities. We propose a vision-based extrinsic contact localization task: with
  only a single RGB-D camera view of a robot workspace, identify when and where an
  object held by the robot contacts the rest of the environment. We show that careful
  task-attuned design is critical for a neural network trained in simulation to discover
  solutions that transfer well to a real robot. Our final approach im2contact demonstrates
  the promise of versatile general-purpose contact perception from vision alone, performing
  well for localizing various contact types (point, line, or planar; sticking, sliding,
  or rolling; single or multiple), and even under occlusions in its camera view. Video
