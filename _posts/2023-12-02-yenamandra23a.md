title: 'HomeRobot: Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: b-cto-fetlz
abstract: 'HomeRobot (noun): An affordable compliant robot that navigates homes and
  manipulates a wide range of objects in order to complete everyday tasks. Open-Vocabulary
  Mobile Manipulation (OVMM) is the problem of picking any object in any unseen environment,
  and placing it in a commanded location. This is a foundational challenge for robots
  to be useful assistants in human environments, because it involves tackling sub-problems
  from across robotics: perception, language understanding, navigation, and manipulation
  are all essential to OVMM. In addition, integration of the solutions to these sub-problems
  poses its own substantial challenges. To drive research in this area, we introduce
  the HomeRobot OVMM benchmark, where an agent navigates household environments to
  grasp novel objects and place them on target receptacles. HomeRobot has two components:
  a simulation component, which uses a large and diverse curated object set in new,
  high-quality multi-room home environments; and a real-world component, providing
  a software stack for the low-cost Hello Robot Stretch to encourage replication of
  real-world experiments across labs. We implement both reinforcement learning and
  heuristic (model-based) baselines and show evidence of sim-to-real transfer. Our
  baselines achieve a $20%$ success rate in the real world; our experiments identify
  ways future research work improve performance. See videos on our website: https://home-robot-ovmm.github.io/.'
