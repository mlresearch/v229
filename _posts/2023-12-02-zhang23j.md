title: A Universal Semantic-Geometric Representation for Robotic Manipulation
section: Poster
openreview: AIgm8ZE_DlD
abstract: 'Robots rely heavily on sensors, especially RGB and depth cameras, to perceive
  and interact with the world. RGB cameras record 2D images with rich semantic information
  while missing precise spatial information. On the other side, depth cameras offer
  critical 3D geometry data but capture limited semantics. Therefore, integrating
  both modalities is crucial for learning representations for robotic perception and
  control. However, current research predominantly focuses on only one of these modalities,
  neglecting the benefits of incorporating both. To this end, we present Semantic-Geometric
  Representation (SGR), a universal perception module for robotics that leverages
  the rich semantic information of large-scale pre-trained 2D models and inherits
  the merits of 3D spatial reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that SGR empowers
  the agent to successfully complete a diverse range of simulated and real-world robotic
  manipulation tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods significantly in both
  single-task and multi-task settings. Furthermore, SGR possesses the capability to
  generalize to novel semantic attributes, setting it apart from the other methods.
