title: 'Diff-LfD: Contact-aware Model-based Learning from Visual Demonstration for
  Robotic Manipulation via Differentiable Physics-based Simulation and Rendering'
section: Oral
openreview: DYPOvNot5F
abstract: 'Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is an efficient technique for robots
  to acquire new skills through expert observation, significantly mitigating the need
  for laborious manual reward function design. This paper introduces a novel framework
  for model-based LfD in the context of robotic manipulation. Our proposed pipeline
  is underpinned by two primary components: self-supervised pose and shape estimation
  and contact sequence generation. The former utilizes differentiable rendering to
  estimate object poses and shapes from demonstration videos, while the latter iteratively
  optimizes contact points and forces using differentiable simulation, consequently
  effectuating object transformations. Empirical evidence demonstrates the efficacy
  of our LfD pipeline in acquiring manipulation actions from human demonstrations.
  Complementary to this, ablation studies focusing on object tracking and contact
  sequence inference underscore the robustness and efficiency of our approach in generating
  long-horizon manipulation actions, even amidst environmental noise. Validation of
  our results extends to real-world deployment of the proposed pipeline. Supplementary
  materials and videos are available on our webpage.'
