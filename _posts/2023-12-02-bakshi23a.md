title: Stealthy Terrain-Aware Multi-Agent Active Search
section: Poster
openreview: eE3fsO5Mi2
abstract: Stealthy multi-agent active search is the problem of making efficient sequential
  data-collection decisions to identify an unknown number of sparsely located targets
  while adapting to new sensing information and concealing the search agents’ location
  from the targets. This problem is applicable to reconnaissance tasks wherein the
  safety of the search agents can be compromised as the targets may be adversarial.
  Prior work usually focuses either on adversarial search, where the risk of revealing
  the agents’ location to the targets is ignored or evasion strategies where efficient
  search is ignored. We present the Stealthy Terrain-Aware Reconnaissance (STAR) algorithm,
  a multi-objective parallelized Thompson sampling-based algorithm that relies on
  a strong topographical prior to reason over changing visibility risk over the course
  of the search. The STAR algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent
  active search methods on both rate of recovery of targets as well as minimising
  risk even when subject to noisy observations, communication failures and an unknown
  number of targets.
