title: 'CAT: Closed-loop Adversarial Training for Safe End-to-End Driving'
section: Poster
openreview: VtJqMs9ig20
abstract: 'Driving safety is a top priority for autonomous vehicles. Orthogonal to
  prior work handling accident-prone traffic events by algorithm designs at the policy
  level, we investigate a Closed-loop Adversarial Training (CAT) framework for safe
  end-to-end driving in this paper through the lens of environment augmentation. CAT
  aims to continuously improve the safety of driving agents by training the agent
  on safety-critical scenarios that are dynamically generated over time. A novel resampling
  technique is developed to turn log-replay real-world driving scenarios into safety-critical
  ones via probabilistic factorization, where the adversarial traffic generation is
  modeled as the multiplication of standard motion prediction sub-problems. Consequently,
  CAT can launch more efficient physical attacks compared to existing safety-critical
  scenario generation methods and yields a significantly less computational cost in
  the iterative learning pipeline. We incorporate CAT into the MetaDrive simulator
  and validate our approach on hundreds of driving scenarios imported from real-world
  driving datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CAT can effectively generate
  adversarial scenarios countering the agent being trained. After training, the agent
  can achieve superior driving safety in both log-replay and safety-critical traffic
  scenarios on the held-out test set. Code and data are available at: https://metadriverse.github.io/cat'
