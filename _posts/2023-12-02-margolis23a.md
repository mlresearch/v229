title: Learning to See Physical Properties with Active Sensing Motor Policies
section: Poster
openreview: RQ_7yVV8vA
abstract: To plan efficient robot locomotion, we must use the information about a
  terrain’s physics that can be inferred from color images. To this end, we train
  a visual perception module that predicts terrain properties using labels from a
  small amount of real-world proprioceptive locomotion. To ensure label precision,
  we introduce Active Sensing Motor Policies (ASMP). These policies are trained to
  prefer motor skills that facilitate accurately estimating the environment’s physics,
  like swiping a foot to observe friction. The estimated labels supervise a vision
  model that infers physical properties directly from color images and can be reused
  for different tasks. Leveraging a pretrained vision backbone, we demonstrate robust
  generalization in image space, enabling path planning from overhead imagery despite
  using only ground camera images for training.
