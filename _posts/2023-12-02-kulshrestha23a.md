title: Structural Concept Learning via Graph Attention for Multi-Level Rearrangement
  Planning
section: Poster
openreview: D0X97ODIYK
abstract: 'Robotic manipulation tasks, such as object rearrangement, play a crucial
  role in enabling robots to interact with complex and arbitrary environments. Existing
  work focuses primarily on single-level rearrangement planning and, even if multiple
  levels exist, dependency relations among substructures are geometrically simpler,
  like tower stacking. We propose Structural Concept Learning (SCL), a deep learning
  approach that leverages graph attention networks to perform multi-level object rearrangement
  planning for scenes with structural dependency hierarchies. It is trained on a self-generated
  simulation data set with intuitive structures, works for unseen scenes with an arbitrary
  number of objects and higher complexity of structures, infers independent substructures
  to allow for task parallelization over multiple manipulators, and generalizes to
  the real world. We compare our method with a range of classical and model-based
  baselines to show that our method leverages its scene understanding to achieve better
  performance, flexibility, and efficiency. The dataset, demonstration videos, supplementary
  details, and code implementation are available at: https://manavkulshrestha.github.io/scl'
