title: 'PLEX: Making the Most of the Available Data for Robotic Manipulation Pretraining'
section: Poster
openreview: Q8BGLiWn2X
abstract: A rich representation is key to general robotic manipulation, but existing
  approaches to representation learning require large amounts of multimodal demonstrations.
  In this work we propose PLEX, a transformer-based architecture that learns from
  a small amount of task-agnostic visuomotor trajectories and a much larger amount
  of task-conditioned object manipulation videos – a type of data available in quantity.
  PLEX uses visuomotor trajectories to induce a latent feature space and to learn
  task-agnostic manipulation routines, while diverse video-only demonstrations teach
  PLEX how to plan in the induced latent feature space for a wide variety of tasks.
  Experiments showcase PLEX’s generalization on Meta-World and SOTA performance in
  challenging Robosuite environments. In particular, using relative positional encoding
  in PLEX’s transformers greatly helps in low-data regimes of learning from human-collected
  demonstrations.
