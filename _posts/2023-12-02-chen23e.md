title: 'Sequential Dexterity: Chaining Dexterous Policies for Long-Horizon Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: 2Qrd-Yw4YmF
abstract: Many real-world manipulation tasks consist of a series of subtasks that
  are significantly different from one another. Such long-horizon, complex tasks highlight
  the potential of dexterous hands, which possess adaptability and versatility, capable
  of seamlessly transitioning between different modes of functionality without the
  need for re-grasping or external tools. However, the challenges arise due to the
  high-dimensional action space of dexterous hand and complex compositional dynamics
  of the long-horizon tasks. We present Sequential Dexterity, a general system based
  on reinforcement learning (RL) that chains multiple dexterous policies for achieving
  long-horizon task goals. The core of the system is a transition feasibility function
  that progressively finetunes the sub-policies for enhancing chaining success rate,
  while also enables autonomous policy-switching for recovery from failures and bypassing
  redundant stages. Despite being trained only in simulation with a few task objects,
  our system demonstrates generalization capability to novel object shapes and is
  able to zero-shot transfer to a real-world robot equipped with a dexterous hand.
