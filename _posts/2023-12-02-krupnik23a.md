title: Fine-Tuning Generative Models as an Inference Method for Robotic Tasks
section: Poster
openreview: yGkqN4hqrJ
abstract: Adaptable models could greatly benefit robotic agents operating in the real
  world, allowing them to deal with novel and varying conditions. While approaches
  such as Bayesian inference are well-studied frameworks for adapting models to evidence,
  we build on recent advances in deep generative models which have greatly affected
  many areas of robotics. Harnessing modern GPU acceleration, we investigate how to
  quickly adapt the sample generation of neural network models to observations in
  robotic tasks. We propose a simple and general method that is applicable to various
  deep generative models and robotic environments. The key idea is to quickly fine-tune
  the model by fitting it to generated samples matching the observed evidence, using
  the cross-entropy method. We show that our method can be applied to both autoregressive
  models and variational autoencoders, and demonstrate its usability in object shape
  inference from grasping, inverse kinematics calculation, and point cloud completion.
