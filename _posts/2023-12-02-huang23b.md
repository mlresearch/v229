abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shown to possess a wealth of actionable
  knowledge that can be extracted for robot manipulation in the form of reasoning
  and planning. Despite the progress, most still rely on pre-defined motion primitives
  to carry out the physical interactions with the environment, which remains a major
  bottleneck. In this work, we aim to synthesize robot trajectories, i.e., a dense
  sequence of 6-DoF end-effector waypoints, for a large variety of manipulation tasks
  given an open-set of instructions and an open-set of objects. We achieve this by
  first observing that LLMs excel at inferring affordances and constraints given a
  free-form language instruction. More importantly, by leveraging their code-writing
  capabilities, they can interact with a vision-language model (VLM) to compose 3D
  value maps to ground the knowledge into the observation space of the agent. The
  composed value maps are then used in a model-based planning framework to zero-shot
  synthesize closed-loop robot trajectories with robustness to dynamic perturbations.
  We further demonstrate how the proposed framework can benefit from online experiences
  by efficiently learning a dynamics model for scenes that involve contact-rich interactions.
  We present a large-scale study of the proposed method in both simulated and real-robot
  environments, showcasing the ability to perform a large variety of everyday manipulation
  tasks specified in free-form natural language.
