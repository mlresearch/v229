title: 'UniFolding: Towards Sample-efficient, Scalable, and Generalizable Robotic
  Garment Folding'
section: Poster
openreview: ANJuNDFdvP
abstract: 'This paper explores the development of UniFolding, a sample-efficient,
  scalable, and generalizable robotic system for unfolding and folding various garments.
  UniFolding employs the proposed UFONet neural network to integrate unfolding and
  folding decisions into a single policy model that is adaptable to different garment
  types and states. The design of UniFolding is based on a garmentâ€™s partial point
  cloud, which aids in generalization and reduces sensitivity to variations in texture
  and shape. The training pipeline prioritizes low-cost, sample-efficient data collection.
  Training data is collected via a human-centric process with offline and online stages.
  The offline stage involves human unfolding and folding actions via Virtual Reality,
  while the online stage utilizes human-in-the-loop learning to fine-tune the model
  in a real-world setting. The system is tested on two garment types: long-sleeve
  and short-sleeve shirts. Performance is evaluated on 20 shirts with significant
  variations in textures, shapes, and materials. More experiments and videos can be
  found in the supplementary materials and on the website: https://unifolding.robotflow.ai.'
