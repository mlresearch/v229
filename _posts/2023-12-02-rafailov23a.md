title: 'MOTO: Offline Pre-training to Online Fine-tuning for Model-based Robot Learning'
section: Poster
openreview: 6Um8P8Fvyhl
abstract: We study the problem of offline pre-training and online fine-tuning for
  reinforcement learning from high-dimensional observations in the context of realistic
  robot tasks. Recent offline model-free approaches successfully use online fine-tuning
  to either improve the performance of the agent over the data collection policy or
  adapt to novel tasks. At the same time, model-based RL algorithms have achieved
  significant progress in sample efficiency and the complexity of the tasks they can
  solve, yet remain under-utilized in the fine-tuning setting. In this work, we argue
  that existing methods for high-dimensional model-based offline RL are not suitable
  for offline-to-online fine-tuning due to issues with distribution shifts, off-dynamics
  data, and non-stationary rewards. We propose an on-policy model-based method that
  can efficiently reuse prior data through model-based value expansion and policy
  regularization, while preventing model exploitation by controlling epistemic uncertainty.
  We find that our approach successfully solves tasks from the MetaWorld benchmark,
  as well as the Franka Kitchen robot manipulation environment completely from images.
  To our knowledge, MOTO is the first and only method to solve this environment from
  pixels.
