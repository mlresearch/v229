title: What Went Wrong? Closing the Sim-to-Real Gap via Differentiable Causal Discovery
section: Poster
openreview: zvl2LuLTtgr
abstract: 'Training control policies in simulation is more appealing than on real
  robots directly, as it allows for exploring diverse states in an efficient manner.
  Yet, robot simulators inevitably exhibit disparities from the real-world \rebut{dynamics},
  yielding inaccuracies that manifest as the dynamical simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real)
  gap. Existing literature has proposed to close this gap by actively modifying specific
  simulator parameters to align the simulated data with real-world observations. However,
  the set of tunable parameters is usually manually selected to reduce the search
  space in a case-by-case manner, which is hard to scale up for complex systems and
  requires extensive domain knowledge. To address the scalability issue and automate
  the parameter-tuning process, we introduce COMPASS, which aligns the simulator with
  the real world by discovering the causal relationship between the environment parameters
  and the sim-to-real gap. Concretely, our method learns a differentiable mapping
  from the environment parameters to the differences between simulated and real-world
  robot-object trajectories. This mapping is governed by a simultaneously learned
  causal graph to help prune the search space of parameters, provide better interpretability,
  and improve generalization on unseen parameters. We perform experiments to achieve
  both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer, and show that our method has significant
  improvements in trajectory alignment and task success rate over strong baselines
  in several challenging manipulation tasks. Demos are available on our project website:
