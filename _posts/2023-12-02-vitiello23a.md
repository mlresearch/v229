title: 'One-Shot Imitation Learning: A Pose Estimation Perspective'
section: Poster
openreview: w5ONmpgnfG
abstract: 'In this paper, we study imitation learning under the challenging setting
  of: (1) only a single demonstration, (2) no further data collection, and (3) no
  prior task or object knowledge. We show how, with these constraints, imitation learning
  can be formulated as a combination of trajectory transfer and unseen object pose
  estimation. To explore this idea, we provide an in-depth study on how state-of-the-art
  unseen object pose estimators perform for one-shot imitation learning on ten real-world
  tasks, and we take a deep dive into the effects that camera calibration, pose estimation
  error, and spatial generalisation have on task success rates. For videos, please
