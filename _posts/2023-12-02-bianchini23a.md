title: Simultaneous Learning of Contact and Continuous Dynamics
section: Poster
openreview: "-3G6_D66Aua"
abstract: 'Robotic manipulation can greatly benefit from the data efficiency, robustness,
  and predictability of model-based methods if robots can quickly generate models
  of novel objects they encounter. This is especially difficult when effects like
  complex joint friction lack clear first-principles models and are usually ignored
  by physics simulators. Further, numerically-stiff contact dynamics can make common
  model-building approaches struggle. We propose a method to simultaneously learn
  contact and continuous dynamics of a novel, possibly multi-link object by observing
  its motion through contact-rich trajectories. We formulate a system identification
  process with a loss that infers unmeasured contact forces, penalizing their violation
  of physical constraints and laws of motion given current model parameters. Our loss
  is unlike prediction-based losses used in differentiable simulation. Using a new
  dataset of real articulated object trajectories and an existing cube toss dataset,
  our method outperforms differentiable simulation and end-to-end alternatives with
  more data efficiency. See our project page for code, datasets, and media: https://sites.google.com/view/continuous-contact-nets/home'
