title: Composable Part-Based Manipulation
section: Poster
openreview: o-K3HVUeEw
abstract: In this paper, we propose composable part-based manipulation (CPM), a novel
  approach that leverages object-part decomposition and part-part correspondences
  to improve learning and generalization of robotic manipulation skills. By considering
  the functional correspondences between object parts, we conceptualize functional
  actions, such as pouring and constrained placing, as combinations of different correspondence
  constraints. CPM comprises a collection of composable diffusion models, where each
  model captures a different inter-object correspondence. These diffusion models can
  generate parameters for manipulation skills based on the specific object parts.
  Leveraging part-based correspondences coupled with the task decomposition into distinct
  constraints enables strong generalization to novel objects and object categories.
  We validate our approach in both simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrating
  its effectiveness in achieving robust and generalized manipulation capabilities.
