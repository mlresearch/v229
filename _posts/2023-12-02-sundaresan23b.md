title: Learning Sequential Acquisition Policies for Robot-Assisted Feeding
section: Poster
openreview: o2wNSCTkq0
abstract: 'A robot providing mealtime assistance must perform specialized maneuvers
  with various utensils in order to pick up and feed a range of food items. Beyond
  these dexterous low-level skills, an assistive robot must also plan these strategies
  in sequence over a long horizon to clear a plate and complete a meal. Previous methods
  in robot-assisted feeding introduce highly specialized primitives for food handling
  without a means to compose them together. Meanwhile, existing approaches to long-horizon
  manipulation lack the flexibility to embed highly specialized primitives into their
  frameworks. We propose Visual Action Planning OveR Sequences (VAPORS), a framework
  for long-horizon food acquisition. VAPORS learns a policy for high-level action
  selection by leveraging learned latent plate dynamics in simulation. To carry out
  sequential plans in the real world, VAPORS delegates action execution to visually
  parameterized primitives. We validate our approach on complex real-world acquisition
  trials involving noodle acquisition and bimanual scooping of jelly beans. Across
  38 plates, VAPORS acquires much more efficiently than baselines, generalizes across
  realistic plate variations such as toppings and sauces, and qualitatively appeals
  to user feeding preferences in a survey conducted across 49 individuals. Code, datasets,
  videos, and supplementary materials can be found on our website: https://sites.google.com/view/vaporsbot.'
