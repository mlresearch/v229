abstract: Segmentation and tracking of unseen object instances in discrete frames
  pose a significant challenge in dynamic industrial robotic contexts, such as distribution
  warehouses. Here, robots must handle object rearrangements, including shifting,
  removal, and partial occlusion by new items, and track these items after substantial
  temporal gaps. The task is further complicated when robots encounter objects beyond
  their training sets, thereby requiring the ability to segment and track previously
  unseen items. Considering that continuous observation is often inaccessible in such
  settings, our task involves working with a discrete set of frames separated by indefinite
  periods, during which substantial changes to the scene may occur. This task also
  translates to domestic robotic applications, such as table rearrangement. To address
  these demanding challenges, we introduce new synthetic and real-world datasets that
  replicate these industrial and household scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a novel
  paradigm for joint segmentation and tracking in discrete frames, alongside a transformer
  module that facilitates efficient inter-frame communication. Our approach significantly
  outperforms recent methods in our experiments. For additional results and videos,

  released.
