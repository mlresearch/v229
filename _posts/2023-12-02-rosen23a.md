title: Synthesizing Navigation Abstractions for Planning with Portable Manipulation
  Skills
section: Poster
openreview: W8MjsxHrDpL
abstract: We address the problem of efficiently learning high-level abstractions for
  task-level robot planning. Existing approaches require large amounts of data and
  fail to generalize learned abstractions to new environments. To address this, we
  propose to exploit the independence between spatial and non-spatial state variables
  in the preconditions of manipulation and navigation skills, mirroring the manipulation-navigation
  split in robotics research. Given a collection of portable manipulation abstractions
  (i.e., object-centric manipulation skills paired with matching symbolic representations),
  we derive an algorithm to automatically generate navigation abstractions that support
  mobile manipulation planning in a novel environment. We apply our approach to simulated
  data in AI2Thor and on real robot hardware with a coffee preparation task, efficiently
  generating plannable representations for mobile manipulators in just a few minutes
  of robot time, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
