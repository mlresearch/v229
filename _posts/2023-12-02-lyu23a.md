title: Task-Oriented Koopman-Based Control with Contrastive Encoder
section: Oral
openreview: q0VAoefCI2
abstract: 'We present task-oriented Koopman-based control that utilizes end-to-end
  reinforcement learning and contrastive encoder to simultaneously learn the Koopman
  latent embedding, operator, and associated linear controller within an iterative
  loop. By prioritizing the task cost as the main objective for controller learning,
  we reduce the reliance of controller design on a well-identified model, which, for
  the first time to the best of our knowledge, extends Koopman control from low to
  high-dimensional, complex nonlinear systems, including pixel-based tasks and a real
  robot with lidar observations. Code and videos are available: https://sites.google.com/view/kpmlilatsupp/.'
