title: 'ADU-Depth: Attention-based Distillation with Uncertainty Modeling for Depth
  Estimation'
section: Poster
openreview: ES_TOp4YJeD
abstract: Monocular depth estimation is challenging due to its inherent ambiguity
  and ill-posed nature, yet it is quite important to many applications. While recent
  works achieve limited accuracy by designing increasingly complicated networks to
  extract features with limited spatial geometric cues from a single RGB image, we
  intend to introduce spatial cues by training a teacher network that leverages left-right
  image pairs as inputs and transferring the learned 3D geometry-aware knowledge to
  the monocular student network. Specifically, we present a novel knowledge distillation
  framework, named ADU-Depth, with the goal of leveraging the well-trained teacher
  network to guide the learning of the student network, thus boosting the precise
  depth estimation with the help of extra spatial scene information. To enable domain
  adaptation and ensure effective and smooth knowledge transfer from teacher to student,
  we apply both attention-adapted feature distillation and focal-depth-adapted response
  distillation in the training stage. In addition, we explicitly model the uncertainty
  of depth estimation to guide distillation in both feature space and result space
  to better produce 3D-aware knowledge from monocular observations and thus enhance
  the learning for hard-to-predict image regions. Our extensive experiments on the
  real depth estimation datasets KITTI and DrivingStereo demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed method, which ranked 1st on the challenging KITTI online benchmark.
