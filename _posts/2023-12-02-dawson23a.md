title: 'A Bayesian approach to breaking things: efficiently predicting and repairing
  failure modes via sampling'
section: Poster
openreview: fNLBmtyBiC
abstract: Before autonomous systems can be deployed in safety-critical applications,
  we must be able to understand and verify the safety of these systems. For cases
  where the risk or cost of real-world testing is prohibitive, we propose a simulation-based
  framework for a) predicting ways in which an autonomous system is likely to fail
  and b) automatically adjusting the systemâ€™s design to preemptively mitigate those
  failures. We frame this problem through the lens of approximate Bayesian inference
  and use differentiable simulation for efficient failure case prediction and repair.
  We apply our approach on a range of robotics and control problems, including optimizing
  search patterns for robot swarms and reducing the severity of outages in power transmission
  networks. Compared to optimization-based falsification techniques, our method predicts
  a more diverse, representative set of failure modes, and we also find that our use
  of differentiable simulation yields solutions that have up to 10x lower cost and
  requires up to 2x fewer iterations to converge relative to gradient-free techniques.
