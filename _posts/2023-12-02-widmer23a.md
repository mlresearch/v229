title: Tuning Legged Locomotion Controllers via Safe Bayesian Optimization
section: Poster
openreview: Tka2U40pHz0
abstract: This paper presents a data-driven strategy to streamline the deployment
  of model-based controllers in legged robotic hardware platforms. Our approach leverages
  a model-free safe learning algorithm to automate the tuning of control gains, addressing
  the mismatch between the simplified model used in the control formulation and the
  real system. This method substantially mitigates the risk of hazardous interactions
  with the robot by sample-efficiently optimizing parameters within a probably safe
  region. Additionally, we extend the applicability of our approach to incorporate
  the different gait parameters as contexts, leading to a safe, sample-efficient exploration
  algorithm capable of tuning a motion controller for diverse gait patterns. We validate
  our method through simulation and hardware experiments, where we demonstrate that
  the algorithm obtains superior performance on tuning a model-based motion controller
  for multiple gaits safely.
