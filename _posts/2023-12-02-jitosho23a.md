title: Reinforcement Learning Enables Real-Time Planning and Control of Agile Maneuvers
  for Soft Robot Arms
section: Poster
openreview: rPye6EZxmI
abstract: Control policies for soft robot arms typically assume quasi-static motion
  or require a hand-designed motion plan. To achieve real-time planning and control
  for tasks requiring highly dynamic maneuvers, we apply deep reinforcement learning
  to train a policy entirely in simulation, and we identify strategies and insights
  that bridge the gap between simulation and reality. In particular, we strengthen
  the policyâ€™s tolerance for inaccuracies with domain randomization and implement
  crucial simulator modifications that improve actuation and sensor modeling, enabling
  zero-shot sim-to-real transfer without requiring high-fidelity soft robot dynamics.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with experiments on physical hardware
  and show that our soft robot can reach target positions that require dynamic swinging
  motions. This is the first work to achieve such agile maneuvers on a physical soft
  robot, advancing the field of soft robot arm planning and control. Our code and
  videos are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/rl-soft-robot.
