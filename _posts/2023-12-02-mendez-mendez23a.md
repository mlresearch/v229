title: Embodied Lifelong Learning for Task and Motion Planning
section: Poster
openreview: ZFjgfJb_5c
abstract: A robot deployed in a home over long stretches of time faces a true lifelong
  learning problem. As it seeks to provide assistance to its users, the robot should
  leverage any accumulated experience to improve its own knowledge and proficiency.
  We formalize this setting with a novel formulation of lifelong learning for task
  and motion planning (TAMP), which endows our learner with the compositionality of
  TAMP systems. Exploiting the modularity of TAMP, we develop a mixture of generative
  models that produces candidate continuous parameters for a planner. Whereas most
  existing lifelong learning approaches determine a priori how data is shared across
  various models, our approach learns shared and non-shared models and determines
  which to use online during planning based on auxiliary tasks that serve as a proxy
  for each model’s understanding of a state. Our method exhibits substantial improvements
  (over time and compared to baselines) in planning success on 2D and BEHAVIOR domains.
