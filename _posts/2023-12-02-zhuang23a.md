title: Robot Parkour Learning
section: Oral
openreview: uo937r5eTE
abstract: 'Parkour is a grand challenge for legged locomotion that requires robots
  to overcome various obstacles rapidly in complex environments. Existing methods
  can generate either diverse but blind locomotion skills or vision-based but specialized
  skills by using reference animal data or complex rewards. However, autonomous parkour
  requires robots to learn generalizable skills that are both vision-based and diverse
  to perceive and react to various scenarios. In this work, we propose a system for
  learning a single end-to-end vision-based parkour policy of diverse parkour skills
  using a simple reward without any reference motion data. We develop a reinforcement
  learning method inspired by direct collocation to generate parkour skills, including
  climbing over high obstacles, leaping over large gaps, crawling beneath low barriers,
  squeezing through thin slits, and running. We distill these skills into a single
  vision-based parkour policy and transfer it to a quadrupedal robot using its egocentric
  depth camera. We demonstrate that our system can empower low-cost quadrupedal robots
  to autonomously select and execute appropriate parkour skills to traverse challenging
  environments in the real world. Project website: https://robot-parkour.github.io/'
