title: 'REBOOT: Reuse Data for Bootstrapping Efficient Real-World Dexterous Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: ckeT8cMz_A
abstract: Dexterous manipulation tasks involving contact-rich interactions pose a
  significant challenge for both model-based control systems and imitation learning
  algorithms. The complexity arises from the need for multi-fingered robotic hands
  to dynamically establish and break contacts, balance forces on the non-prehensile
  object, and control a high number of degrees of freedom. Reinforcement learning
  (RL) offers a promising approach due to its general applicability and capacity to
  autonomously acquire optimal manipulation strategies. However, its real-world application
  is often hindered by the necessity to generate a large number of samples, reset
  the environment, and obtain reward signals. In this work, we introduce an efficient
  system for learning dexterous manipulation skills with RL to alleviate these challenges.
  The main idea of our approach is the integration of recent advancements in sample-efficient
  RL and replay buffer bootstrapping. This unique combination allows us to utilize
  data from different tasks or objects as a starting point for training new tasks,
  significantly improving learning efficiency. Additionally, our system completes
  the real-world training cycle by incorporating learned resets via an imitation-based
  pickup policy and learned reward functions, to eliminate the need for manual reset
  and reward engineering. We show the benefits of reusing past data as replay buffer
  initialization for new tasks, for instance, the fast acquisitions of intricate manipulation
  skills in the real world on a four-fingered robotic hand. https://sites.google.com/view/reboot-dexterous
