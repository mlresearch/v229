title: Preference learning for guiding the tree search in continuous POMDPs
section: Poster
openreview: '09UL1dCqf2n'
abstract: A robot operating in a partially observable environment must perform sensing
  actions to achieve a goal, such as clearing the objects in front of a shelf to better
  localize a target object at the back, and estimate its shape for grasping. A POMDP
  is a principled framework for enabling robots to perform such information-gathering
  actions. Unfortunately, while robot manipulation domains involve high-dimensional
  and continuous observation and action spaces, most POMDP solvers are limited to
  discrete spaces. Recently, POMCPOW has been proposed for continuous POMDPs, which
  handles continuity using sampling and progressive widening. However, for robot manipulation
  problems involving camera observations and multiple objects, POMCPOW is too slow
  to be practical. We take inspiration from the recent work in learning to guide task
  and motion planning to propose a framework that learns to guide POMCPOW from past
  planning experience. Our method uses preference learning that utilizes both success
  and failure trajectories, where the preference label is given by the results of
  the tree search. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in several continuous
  partially observable robotics domains, including real-world manipulation, where
  our framework explicitly reasons about the uncertainty in off-the-shelf segmentation
  and pose estimation algorithms.
