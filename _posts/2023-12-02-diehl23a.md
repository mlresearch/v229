title: Energy-based Potential Games for Joint Motion Forecasting and Control
section: Poster
openreview: Eyb4e3GBuuR
abstract: This work uses game theory as a mathematical framework to address interaction
  modeling in multi-agent motion forecasting and control. Despite its interpretability,
  applying game theory to real-world robotics, like automated driving, faces challenges
  such as unknown game parameters. To tackle these, we establish a connection between
  differential games, optimal control, and energy-based models, demonstrating how
  existing approaches can be unified under our proposed Energy-based Potential Game
  formulation. Building upon this, we introduce a new end-to-end learning application
  that combines neural networks for game-parameter inference with a differentiable
  game-theoretic optimization layer, acting as an inductive bias. The analysis provides
  empirical evidence that the game-theoretic layer adds interpretability and improves
  the predictive performance of various neural network backbones using two simulations
  and two real-world driving datasets.
