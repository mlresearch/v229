title: 'Tell Me Where to Go: A Composable Framework for Context-Aware Embodied Robot
  Navigation'
section: Poster
openreview: fviZhMCr62
abstract: Humans have the remarkable ability to navigate through unfamiliar environments
  by solely relying on our prior knowledge and descriptions of the environment. For
  robots to perform the same type of navigation, they need to be able to associate
  natural language descriptions with their associated physical environment with a
  limited amount of prior knowledge. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been
  able to reason over billions of parameters and utilize them in multi-modal chat-based
  natural language responses. However, LLMs lack real-world awareness and their outputs
  are not always predictable. In this work, we develop a low-bandwidth framework that
  solves this lack of real-world generalization by creating an intermediate layer
  between an LLM and a robot navigation framework in the form of Python code. Our
  intermediate shoehorns the vast prior knowledge inherent in an LLM model into a
  series of input and output API instructions that a mobile robot can understand.
  We evaluate our method across four different environments and command classes on
  a mobile robot and highlight our frameworkâ€™s ability to interpret contextual commands.
