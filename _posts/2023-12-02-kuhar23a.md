title: 'Learning to Discern: Imitating Heterogeneous Human Demonstrations with Preference
  and Representation Learning'
section: Poster
openreview: kOm3jWX8YN
abstract: Practical Imitation Learning (IL) systems rely on large human demonstration
  datasets for successful policy learning. However, challenges lie in maintaining
  the quality of collected data and addressing the suboptimal nature of some demonstrations,
  which can compromise the overall dataset quality and hence the learning outcome.
  Furthermore, the intrinsic heterogeneity in human behavior can produce equally successful
  but disparate demonstrations, further exacerbating the challenge of discerning demonstration
  quality. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Learning to Discern
  (L2D), an offline imitation learning framework for learning from demonstrations
  with diverse quality and style. Given a small batch of demonstrations with sparse
  quality labels, we learn a latent representation for temporally embedded trajectory
  segments. Preference learning in this latent space trains a quality evaluator that
  generalizes to new demonstrators exhibiting different styles. Empirically, we show
  that L2D can effectively assess and learn from varying demonstrations, thereby leading
  to improved policy performance across a range of tasks in both simulations and on
  a physical robot.
