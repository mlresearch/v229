title: Seeing-Eye Quadruped Navigation with Force Responsive Locomotion Control
section: Poster
openreview: X7okQlJz9M
abstract: Seeing-eye robots are very useful tools for guiding visually impaired people,
  potentially producing a huge societal impact given the low availability and high
  cost of real guide dogs. Although a few seeing-eye robot systems have already been
  demonstrated, none considered external tugs from humans, which frequently occur
  in a real guide dog setting. In this paper, we simultaneously train a locomotion
  controller that is robust to external tugging forces via Reinforcement LearningÂ (RL),
  and an external force estimator via supervised learning. The controller ensures
  stable walking, and the force estimator enables the robot to respond to the external
  forces from the human. These forces are used to guide the robot to the global goal,
  which is unknown to the robot, while the robot guides the human around nearby obstacles
  via a local planner. Experimental results in simulation and on hardware show that
  our controller is robust to external forces, and our seeing-eye system can accurately
  detect force direction. We demonstrate our full seeing-eye robot system on a real
  quadruped robot with a blindfolded human.
