title: Affordance-Driven Next-Best-View Planning for Robotic Grasping
section: Poster
openreview: IeKC9khX5jD
abstract: 'Grasping occluded objects in cluttered environments is an essential component
  in complex robotic manipulation tasks. In this paper, we introduce an AffordanCE-driven
  Next-Best-View planning policy (ACE-NBV) that tries to find a feasible grasp for
  target object via continuously observing scenes from new viewpoints. This policy
  is motivated by the observation that the grasp affordances of an occluded object
  can be better-measured under the view when the view-direction are the same as the
  grasp view. Specifically, our method leverages the paradigm of novel view imagery
  to predict the grasps affordances under previously unobserved view, and select next
  observation view based on the highest imagined grasp quality of the target object.
  The experimental results in simulation and on a real robot demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed affordance-driven next-best-view planning policy. Project page:
