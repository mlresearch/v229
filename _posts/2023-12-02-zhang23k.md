title: 'Push Past Green: Learning to Look Behind Plant Foliage by Moving It'
section: Poster
openreview: 8asqEWO479I
abstract: 'Autonomous agriculture applications (e.g., inspection, phenotyping, plucking
  fruits) require manipulating the plant foliage to look behind the leaves and the
  branches. Partial visibility, extreme clutter, thin structures, and unknown geometry
  and dynamics for plants make such manipulation challenging. We tackle these challenges
  through data-driven methods. We use self-supervision to train SRPNet, a neural network
  that predicts what space is revealed on execution of a candidate action on a given
  plant. We use SRPNet with the cross-entropy method to predict actions that are effective
  at revealing space beneath plant foliage. Furthermore, as SRPNet does not just predict
  how much space is revealed but also where it is revealed, we can execute a sequence
  of actions that incrementally reveal more and more space beneath the plant foliage.
  We experiment with a synthetic (vines) and a real plant (Dracaena) on a physical
  test-bed across 5 settings including 2 settings that test generalization to novel
  plant configurations. Our experiments reveal the effectiveness of our overall method,
  PPG, over a competitive hand-crafted exploration method, and the effectiveness of
  SRPNet over a hand-crafted dynamics model and relevant ablations. Project website
