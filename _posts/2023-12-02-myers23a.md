title: 'Goal Representations for Instruction Following: A Semi-Supervised Language
  Interface to Control'
section: Poster
openreview: 0bZaUfELuW
abstract: 'Our goal is for robots to follow natural language instructions like “put
  the towel next to the microwave.” But getting large amounts of labeled data, i.e.
  data that contains demonstrations of tasks labeled with the language instruction,
  is prohibitive. In contrast, obtaining policies that respond to image goals is much
  easier, because any autonomous trial or demonstration can be labeled in hindsight
  with its final state as the goal. In this work, we contribute a method that taps
  into joint image- and goal- conditioned policies with language using only a small
  amount of language data. Prior work has made progress on this using vision-language
  models or by jointly training language-goal-conditioned policies, but so far neither
  method has scaled effectively to real-world robot tasks without significant human
  annotation. Our method achieves robust performance in the real world by learning
  an embedding from the labeled data that aligns language not to the goal image, but
  rather to the desired change between the start and goal images that the instruction
  corresponds to. We then train a policy on this embedding: the policy benefits from
  all the unlabeled data, but the aligned embedding provides an *interface* for language
  to steer the policy. We show instruction following across a variety of manipulation
  tasks in different scenes, with generalization to language instructions outside
  of the labeled data.'
