title: 'Cross-Dataset Sensor Alignment: Making Visual 3D Object Detector Generalizable'
section: Poster
openreview: dIgCPoy8E3
abstract: While camera-based 3D object detection has evolved rapidly, these models
  are susceptible to overfitting to specific sensor setups. For example, in autonomous
  driving, most datasets are collected using a single sensor configuration. This paper
  evaluates the generalization capability of camera-based 3D object detectors, including
  adapting detectors from one dataset to another and training detectors with multiple
  datasets. We observe that merely aggregating datasets yields drastic performance
  drops, contrary to the expected improvements associated with increased training
  data. To close the gap, we introduce an efficient technique for aligning disparate
  sensor configurations â€” a combination of camera intrinsic synchronization, camera
  extrinsic correction, and ego frame alignment, which collectively enhance cross-dataset
  performance remarkably. Compared with single dataset baselines, we achieve 42.3
  mAP improvement on KITTI, 23.2 mAP improvement on Lyft, 18.5 mAP improvement on
  nuScenes, 17.3 mAP improvement on KITTI-360, 8.4 mAP improvement on Argoverse2 and
  3.9 mAP improvement on Waymo. We hope this comprehensive study can facilitate research
  on generalizable 3D object detection and associated tasks.
