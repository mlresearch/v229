title: '4D-Former: Multimodal 4D Panoptic Segmentation'
section: Poster
openreview: XsWGVbPfB4Z
abstract: '4D panoptic segmentation is a challenging but practically useful task that
  requires every point in a LiDAR point-cloud sequence to be assigned a semantic class
  label, and individual objects to be segmented and tracked over time. Existing approaches
  utilize only LiDAR inputs which convey limited information in regions with point
  sparsity. This problem can, however, be mitigated by utilizing RGB camera images
  which offer appearance-based information that can reinforce the geometry-based LiDAR
  features. Motivated by this, we propose 4D-Former: a novel method for 4D panoptic
  segmentation which leverages both LiDAR and image modalities, and predicts semantic
  masks as well as temporally consistent object masks for the input point-cloud sequence.
  We encode semantic classes and objects using a set of concise queries which absorb
  feature information from both data modalities. Additionally, we propose a learned
  mechanism to associate object tracks over time which reasons over both appearance
  and spatial location. We apply 4D-Former to the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets
  where it achieves state-of-the-art results.'
