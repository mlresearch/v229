title: 'Language-guided Robot Grasping: CLIP-based Referring Grasp Synthesis in Clutter'
section: Poster
openreview: j2AQ-WJ_ze
abstract: Robots operating in human-centric environments require the integration of
  visual grounding and grasping capabilities to effectively manipulate objects based
  on user instructions. This work focuses on the task of referring grasp synthesis,
  which predicts a grasp pose for an object referred through natural language in cluttered
  scenes. Existing approaches often employ multi-stage pipelines that first segment
  the referred object and then propose a suitable grasp, and are evaluated in private
  datasets or simulators that do not capture the complexity of natural indoor scenes.
  To address these limitations, we develop a challenging benchmark based on cluttered
  indoor scenes from OCID dataset, for which we generate referring expressions and
  connect them with 4-DoF grasp poses. Further, we propose a novel end-to-end model
  (CROG) that leverages the visual grounding capabilities of CLIP to learn grasp synthesis
  directly from image-text pairs. Our results show that vanilla integration of CLIP
  with pretrained models transfers poorly in our challenging benchmark, while CROG
  achieves significant improvements both in terms of grounding and grasping. Extensive
  robot experiments in both simulation and hardware demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our approach in challenging interactive object grasping scenarios that include
  clutter.
