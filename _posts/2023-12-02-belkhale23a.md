title: 'HYDRA: Hybrid Robot Actions for Imitation Learning'
section: Poster
openreview: _A15qsPswaK
abstract: 'Imitation Learning (IL) is a sample efficient paradigm for robot learning
  using expert demonstrations. However, policies learned through IL suffer from state
  distribution shift at test time, due to compounding errors in action prediction
  which lead to previously unseen states. Choosing an action representation for the
  policy that minimizes this distribution shift is critical in imitation learning.
  Prior work propose using temporal action abstractions to reduce compounding errors,
  but they often sacrifice policy dexterity or require domain-specific knowledge.
  To address these trade-offs, we introduce HYDRA, a method that leverages a hybrid
  action space with two levels of action abstractions: sparse high-level waypoints
  and dense low-level actions. HYDRA dynamically switches between action abstractions
  at test time to enable both coarse and fine-grained control of a robot. In addition,
  HYDRA employs action relabeling to increase the consistency of actions in the dataset,
  further reducing distribution shift. HYDRA outperforms prior imitation learning
  methods by $30-40%$ on seven challenging simulation and real world environments,
  involving long-horizon tasks in the real world like making coffee and toasting bread.
