title: 'Act3D: 3D Feature Field Transformers for Multi-Task Robotic Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: "-HFJuX1uqs"
abstract: 3D perceptual representations are well suited for robot manipulation as
  they easily encode occlusions and simplify spatial reasoning. Many manipulation
  tasks require high spatial precision in end-effector pose prediction, which typically
  demands high-resolution 3D feature grids that are computationally expensive to process.
  As a result, most manipulation policies operate directly in 2D, foregoing 3D inductive
  biases. In this paper, we introduce Act3D, a manipulation policy transformer that
  represents the robotâ€™s workspace using a 3D feature field with adaptive resolutions
  dependent on the task at hand. The model lifts 2D pre-trained features to 3D using
  sensed depth, and attends to them to compute features for sampled 3D points. It
  samples 3D point grids in a coarse to fine manner, featurizes them using relative-position
  attention, and selects where to focus the next round of point sampling. In this
  way, it efficiently computes 3D action maps of high spatial resolution. Act3D sets
  a new state-of-the-art in RLBench, an established manipulation benchmark, where
  it achieves $10%$ absolute improvement over the previous SOTA 2D multi-view policy
  on 74 RLBench tasks and $22%$ absolute improvement with 3x less compute over the
  previous SOTA 3D policy. We quantify the importance of relative spatial attention,
  large-scale vision-language pre-trained 2D backbones, and weight tying across coarse-to-fine
  attentions in ablative experiments.
