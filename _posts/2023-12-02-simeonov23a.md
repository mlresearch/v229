title: 'Shelving, Stacking, Hanging: Relational Pose Diffusion for Multi-modal Rearrangement'
section: Poster
openreview: _xFJuqBId8c
abstract: 'We propose a system for rearranging objects in a scene to achieve a desired
  object-scene placing relationship, such as a book inserted in an open slot of a
  bookshelf. The pipeline generalizes to novel geometries, poses, and layouts of both
  scenes and objects, and is trained from demonstrations to operate directly on 3D
  point clouds. Our system overcomes challenges associated with the existence of many
  geometrically-similar rearrangement solutions for a given scene. By leveraging an
  iterative pose de-noising training procedure, we can fit multi-modal demonstration
  data and produce multi-modal outputs while remaining precise and accurate. We also
  show the advantages of conditioning on relevant local geometric features while ignoring
  irrelevant global structure that harms both generalization and precision. We demonstrate
  our approach on three distinct rearrangement tasks that require handling multi-modality
  and generalization over object shape and pose in both simulation and the real world.
