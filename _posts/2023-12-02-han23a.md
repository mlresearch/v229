title: On the Utility of Koopman Operator Theory in Learning Dexterous Manipulation
  Skills
section: Oral
openreview: pw-OTIYrGa
abstract: Despite impressive dexterous manipulation capabilities enabled by learning-based
  approaches, we are yet to witness widespread adoption beyond well-resourced laboratories.
  This is likely due to practical limitations, such as significant computational burden,
  inscrutable learned behaviors, sensitivity to initialization, and the considerable
  technical expertise required for implementation. In this work, we investigate the
  utility of Koopman operator theory in alleviating these limitations. Koopman operators
  are simple yet powerful control-theoretic structures to represent complex nonlinear
  dynamics as linear systems in higher dimensions. Motivated by the fact that complex
  nonlinear dynamics underlie dexterous manipulation, we develop a Koopman operator-based
  imitation learning framework to learn the desired motions of both the robotic hand
  and the object simultaneously. We show that Koopman operators are surprisingly effective
  for dexterous manipulation and offer a number of unique benefits. Notably, policies
  can be learned analytically, drastically reducing computation burden and eliminating
  sensitivity to initialization and the need for painstaking hyperparameter optimization.
  Our experiments reveal that a Koopman operator-based approach can perform comparably
  to state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms in terms of success rate and sample
  efficiency, while being an order of magnitude faster. Policy videos can be viewed
