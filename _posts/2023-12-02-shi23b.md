title: Waypoint-Based Imitation Learning for Robotic Manipulation
section: Poster
openreview: X0cmlTh1Vl
abstract: While imitation learning methods have seen a resurgent interest for robotic
  manipulation, the well-known problem of compounding errors continues to afflict
  behavioral cloning (BC). Waypoints can help address this problem by reducing the
  horizon of the learning problem for BC, and thus, the errors compounded over time.
  However, waypoint labeling is underspecified, and requires additional human supervision.
  Can we generate waypoints automatically without any additional human supervision?
  Our key insight is that if a trajectory segment can be approximated by linear motion,
  the endpoints can be used as waypoints. We propose Automatic Waypoint Extraction
  (AWE) for imitation learning, a preprocessing module to decompose a demonstration
  into a minimal set of waypoints which when interpolated linearly can approximate
  the trajectory up to a specified error threshold. AWE can be combined with any BC
  algorithm, and we find that AWE can increase the success rate of state-of-the-art
  algorithms by up to $25%$ in simulation and by $4-28%$ on real-world bimanual manipulation
  tasks, reducing the decision making horizon by up to a factor of 10. Videos and
  code are available at https://lucys0.github.io/awe/.
