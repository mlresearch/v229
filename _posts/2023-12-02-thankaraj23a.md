title: 'That Sounds Right: Auditory Self-Supervision for Dynamic Robot Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: sLhk0keeiseH
abstract: 'Learning to produce contact-rich, dynamic behaviors from raw sensory data
  has been a longstanding challenge in robotics. Prominent approaches primarily focus
  on using visual and tactile sensing. However, pure vision often fails to capture
  high-frequency interaction, while current tactile sensors can be too delicate for
  large-scale data collection. In this work, we propose a data-centric approach to
  dynamic manipulation that uses an often ignored source of information – sound. We
  first collect a dataset of 25k interaction-sound pairs across five dynamic tasks
  using contact microphones. Then, given this data, we leverage self-supervised learning
  to accelerate behavior prediction from sound. Our experiments indicate that this
  self-supervised ‘pretraining’ is crucial to achieving high performance, with a $34.5%$
  lower MSE than plain supervised learning and a $54.3%$ lower MSE over visual training.
  Importantly, we find that when asked to generate desired sound profiles, online
  rollouts of our models on a UR10 robot can produce dynamic behavior that achieves
  an average of $11.5%$ improvement over supervised learning on audio similarity metrics.
