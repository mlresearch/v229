title: Intent-Aware Planning in Heterogeneous Traffic via Distributed Multi-Agent
  Reinforcement Learning
section: Oral
openreview: EvuAJ0wD98
abstract: 'Navigating safely and efficiently in dense and heterogeneous traffic scenarios
  is challenging for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their inability to infer the
  behaviors or intentions of nearby drivers. In this work, we introduce a distributed
  multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm for joint trajectory and intent
  prediction for autonomous vehicles in dense and heterogeneous environments. Our
  approach for intent-aware planning, iPLAN, allows agents to infer nearby drivers’
  intents solely from their local observations. We model an explicit representation
  of agents’ private incentives: Behavioral Incentive for high-level decision-making
  strategy that sets planning sub-goals and Instant Incentive for low-level motion
  planning to execute sub-goals. Our approach enables agents to infer their opponents’
  behavior incentives and integrate this inferred information into their decision-making
  and motion-planning processes. We perform experiments on two simulation environments,
  Non-Cooperative Navigation and Heterogeneous Highway. In Heterogeneous Highway,
  results show that, compared with centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE)
  MARL baselines such as QMIX and MAPPO, our method yields a $4.3%$ and $38.4%$ higher
  episodic reward in mild and chaotic traffic, with $48.1%$ higher success rate and
  $80.6%$ longer survival time in chaotic traffic. We also compare with a decentralized
  training decentralized execution (DTDE) baseline IPPO and demonstrate a higher episodic
  reward of $12.7%$ and $6.3%$ in mild traffic and chaotic traffic, $25.3%$ higher
  success rate, and $13.7%$ longer survival time.'
