title: Learning Lyapunov-Stable Polynomial Dynamical Systems Through Imitation
section: Poster
openreview: Pwsm7d0iWJD
abstract: Imitation learning is a paradigm to address complex motion planning problems
  by learning a policy to imitate an expert’s behavior. However, relying solely on
  the expert’s data might lead to unsafe actions when the robot deviates from the
  demonstrated trajectories. Stability guarantees have previously been provided utilizing
  nonlinear dynamical systems, acting as high-level motion planners, in conjunction
  with the Lyapunov stability theorem. Yet, these methods are prone to inaccurate
  policies, high computational cost, sample inefficiency, or quasi stability when
  replicating complex and highly nonlinear trajectories. To mitigate this problem,
  we present an approach for learning a globally stable nonlinear dynamical system
  as a motion planning policy. We model the nonlinear dynamical system as a parametric
  polynomial and learn the polynomial’s coefficients jointly with a Lyapunov candidate.
  To showcase its success, we compare our method against the state of the art in simulation
  and conduct real-world experiments with the Kinova Gen3 Lite manipulator arm. Our
  experiments demonstrate the sample efficiency and reproduction accuracy of our method
  for various expert trajectories, while remaining stable in the face of perturbations.
