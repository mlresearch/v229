title: Task Generalization with Stability Guarantees via Elastic Dynamical System
  Motion Policies
section: Poster
openreview: 8scj3Y0RLq
abstract: Dynamical System (DS) based Learning from Demonstration (LfD) allows learning
  of reactive motion policies with stability and convergence guarantees from a few
  trajectories. Yet, current DS learning techniques lack the flexibility to generalize
  to new task instances as they overlook explicit task parameters that inherently
  change the underlying demonstrated trajectories. In this work, we propose Elastic-DS,
  a novel DS learning and generalization approach that embeds task parameters into
  the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) DS formulation.
  Central to our approach is the Elastic-GMM, a GMM constrained to SE(3) task-relevant
  frames. Given a new task instance/context, the Elastic-GMM is transformed with Laplacian
  Editing and used to re-estimate the LPV-DS policy. Elastic-DS is compositional in
  nature and can be used to construct flexible multi-step tasks. We showcase its strength
  on a myriad of simulated and real-robot experiments while preserving desirable control-theoretic
  guarantees.
