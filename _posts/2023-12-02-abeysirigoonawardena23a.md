title: Generating Transferable Adversarial Simulation Scenarios for Self-Driving via
  Neural Rendering
section: Poster
openreview: 4uFVn6WHyzo
abstract: Self-driving software pipelines include components that are learned from
  a significant number of training examples, yet it remains challenging to evaluate
  the overall systemâ€™s safety and generalization performance. Together with scaling
  up the real-world deployment of autonomous vehicles, it is of critical importance
  to automatically find simulation scenarios where the driving policies will fail.
  We propose a method that efficiently generates adversarial simulation scenarios
  for autonomous driving by solving an optimal control problem that aims to maximally
  perturb the policy from its nominal trajectory. Given an image-based driving policy,
  we show that we can inject new objects in a neural rendering representation of the
  deployment scene, and optimize their texture in order to generate adversarial sensor
  inputs to the policy. We demonstrate that adversarial scenarios discovered purely
  in the neural renderer (surrogate scene) can often be successfully transferred to
  the deployment scene, without further optimization. We demonstrate this transfer
  occurs both in simulated and real environments, provided the learned surrogate scene
  is sufficiently close to the deployment scene.
