title: "$α$-MDF: An Attention-based Multimodal Differentiable Filter for Robot State
  Estimation"
section: Poster
openreview: 0hQMcWfjG9
abstract: Differentiable Filters are recursive Bayesian estimators that derive the
  state transition and measurement models from data alone. Their data-driven nature
  eschews the need for explicit analytical models, while remaining algorithmic components
  of the filtering process intact. As a result, the gain mechanism – a critical component
  of the filtering process – remains non-differentiable and cannot be adjusted to
  the specific nature of the task or context. In this paper, we propose an attention-based
  Multimodal Differentiable Filter ($\alpha$-MDF) which utilizes modern attention
  mechanisms to learn multimodal latent representations. Unlike previous differentiable
  filter frameworks, $\alpha$-MDF substitutes the traditional gain, e.g., the Kalman
  gain, with a neural attention mechanism. The approach generates specialized, context-dependent
  gains that can effectively combine multiple input modalities and observed variables.
  We validate $\alpha$-MDF on a diverse set of robot state estimation tasks in real
  world and simulation. Our results show $\alpha$-MDF achieves significant reductions
  in state estimation errors, demonstrating nearly 4-fold improvements compared to
  state-of-the-art sensor fusion strategies for rigid body robots. Additionally, the
  $\alpha$-MDF consistently outperforms differentiable filter baselines by up to $45%$
  in soft robotics tasks. The project is available at alpha-mdf.github.io and the
  codebase is at github.com/ir-lab/alpha-MDF
