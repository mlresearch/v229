title: 'SayPlan: Grounding Large Language Models using 3D Scene Graphs for Scalable
  Robot Task Planning'
section: Oral
openreview: wMpOMO0Ss7a
abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results in developing
  generalist planning agents for diverse tasks. However, grounding these plans in
  expansive, multi-floor, and multi-room environments presents a significant challenge
  for robotics. We introduce SayPlan, a scalable approach to LLM-based, large-scale
  task planning for robotics using 3D scene graph (3DSG) representations. To ensure
  the scalability of our approach, we: (1) exploit the hierarchical nature of 3DSGs
  to allow LLMs to conduct a "semantic search" for task-relevant subgraphs from a
  smaller, collapsed representation of the full graph; (2) reduce the planning horizon
  for the LLM by integrating a classical path planner and (3) introduce an "iterative
  replanning" pipeline that refines the initial plan using feedback from a scene graph
  simulator, correcting infeasible actions and avoiding planning failures. We evaluate
  our approach on two large-scale environments spanning up to 3 floors and 36 rooms
  with 140 assets and objects and show that our approach is capable of grounding large-scale,
  long-horizon task plans from abstract, and natural language instruction for a mobile
  manipulator robot to execute. We provide real robot video demonstrations on our
  project page https://sayplan.github.io.'
