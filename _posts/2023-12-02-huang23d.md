title: 'Dynamic Handover: Throw and Catch with Bimanual Hands'
section: Poster
openreview: dgwvY3H8PAS
abstract: 'Humans throw and catch objects all the time. However, such a seemingly
  common skill introduces a lot of challenges for robots to achieve: The robots need
  to operate such dynamic actions at high-speed, collaborate precisely, and interact
  with diverse objects. In this paper, we design a system with two multi-finger hands
  attached to robot arms to solve this problem. We train our system using Multi-Agent
  Reinforcement Learning in simulation and perform Sim2Real transfer to deploy on
  the real robots. To overcome the Sim2Real gap, we provide multiple novel algorithm
  designs including learning a trajectory prediction model for the object. Such a
  model can help the robot catcher has a real-time estimation of where the object
  will be heading, and then react accordingly. We conduct our experiments with multiple
  objects in the real-world system, and show significant improvements over multiple
  baselines. Our project page is available at https://binghao-huang.github.io/dynamic_handover/'
