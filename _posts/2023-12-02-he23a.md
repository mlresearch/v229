title: Quantifying Assistive Robustness Via the Natural-Adversarial Frontier
section: Poster
openreview: diOr96f65N
abstract: 'Our ultimate goal is to build robust policies for robots that assist people.
  What makes this hard is that people can behave unexpectedly at test time, potentially
  interacting with the robot outside its training distribution and leading to failures.
  Even just measuring robustness is a challenge. Adversarial perturbations are the
  default, but they can paint the wrong picture: they can correspond to human motions
  that are unlikely to occur during natural interactions with people. A robot policy
  might fail under small adversarial perturbations but work under large natural perturbations.
  We propose that capturing robustness in these interactive settings requires constructing
  and analyzing the entire natural-adversarial frontier: the Pareto-frontier of human
  policies that are the best trade-offs between naturalness and low robot performance.
  We introduce RIGID, a method for constructing this frontier by training adversarial
  human policies that trade off between minimizing robot reward and acting human-like
  (as measured by a discriminator). On an Assistive Gym task, we use RIGID to analyze
  the performance of standard collaborative RL, as well as the performance of existing
  methods meant to increase robustness. We also compare the frontier RIGID identifies
  with the failures identified in expert adversarial interaction, and with naturally-occurring
  failures during user interaction. Overall, we find evidence that RIGID can provide
  a meaningful measure of robustness predictive of deployment performance, and uncover
  failure cases that are difficult to find manually.'
