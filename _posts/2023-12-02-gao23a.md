title: 'SA6D: Self-Adaptive Few-Shot 6D Pose Estimator for Novel and Occluded Objects'
section: Poster
openreview: gdkKi_F55h
abstract: To enable meaningful robotic manipulation of objects in the real-world,
  6D pose estimation is one of the critical aspects. Most existing approaches have
  difficulties to extend predictions to scenarios where novel object instances are
  continuously introduced, especially with heavy occlusions. In this work, we propose
  a few-shot pose estimation (FSPE) approach called SA6D, which uses a self-adaptive
  segmentation module to identify the novel target object and construct a point cloud
  model of the target object using only a small number of cluttered reference images.
  Unlike existing methods, SA6D does not require object-centric reference images or
  any additional object information, making it a more generalizable and scalable solution
  across categories. We evaluate SA6D on real-world tabletop object datasets and demonstrate
  that SA6D outperforms existing FSPE methods, particularly in cluttered scenes with
  occlusions, while requiring fewer reference images.
