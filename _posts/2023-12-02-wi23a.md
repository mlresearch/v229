title: 'CALAMARI: Contact-Aware and Language conditioned spatial Action MApping for
  contact-RIch manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: Nii0_rRJwN
abstract: Making contact with purpose is a central part of robot manipulation and
  remains essential for many household tasks – from sweeping dust into a dustpan,
  to wiping tables; from erasing whiteboards, to applying paint. In this work, we
  investigate learning language-conditioned, vision-based manipulation policies wherein
  the action representation is in fact, contact itself – predicting contact formations
  at which tools grasped by the robot should meet an observable surface. Our approach,
  Contact-Aware and Language conditioned spatial Action MApping for contact-RIch manipulation
  (CALAMARI), exhibits several advantages including (i) benefiting from existing visual-language
  models for pretrained spatial features, grounding instructions to behaviors, and
  for sim2real transfer; and (ii) factorizing perception and control over a natural
  boundary (i.e. contact) into two modules that synergize with each other, whereby
  action predictions can be aligned per pixel with image observations, and low-level
  controllers can optimize motion trajectories that maintain contact while avoiding
  penetration. Experiments show that CALAMARI outperforms existing state-of-the-art
  model architectures for a broad range of contact-rich tasks, and pushes new ground
  on embodiment-agnostic generalization to unseen objects with varying elasticity,
  geometry, and colors in both simulated and real-world settings.
