title: Grounding Complex Natural Language Commands for Temporal Tasks in Unseen Environments
section: Poster
openreview: rpWi4SYGXj
abstract: Grounding navigational commands to linear temporal logic (LTL) leverages
  its unambiguous semantics for reasoning about long-horizon tasks and verifying the
  satisfaction of temporal constraints. Existing approaches require training data
  from the specific environment and landmarks that will be used in natural language
  to understand commands in those environments. We propose Lang2LTL, a modular system
  and a software package that leverages large language models (LLMs) to ground temporal
  navigational commands to LTL specifications in environments without prior language
  data. We comprehensively evaluate Lang2LTL for five well-defined generalization
  behaviors. Lang2LTL demonstrates the state-of-the-art ability of a single model
  to ground navigational commands to diverse temporal specifications in 21 city-scaled
  environments. Finally, we demonstrate a physical robot using Lang2LTL can follow
  52 semantically diverse navigational commands in two indoor environments.
