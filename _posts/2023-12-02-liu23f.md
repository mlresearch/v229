  Reinforcement Learning'
section: Poster

abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a popular technique
  in diverse domains due to its ability to automate system controller design and facilitate
  continuous intelligence learning. For instance, traffic flow is often trained with
  MARL to enable intelligent simulations for autonomous driving. However, The existing
  MARL algorithm only characterizes the relative degree of each agentâ€™s contribution
  to the team, and cannot express the contribution that the team needs from the agent.
  Especially in the field of autonomous driving, the team changes over time, and the
  agent needs to act directly according to the needs of the team. To address these
  limitations, we propose an innovative method inspired by realistic traffic coordinators
  called the Traffic Coordinator Network (TraCo). Our approach leverages a combination
  of cross-attention and counterfactual advantage function, allowing us to extract
  distinctive characteristics of domain agents and accurately quantify the contribution
  that a team needs from an agent. Through experiments conducted on four traffic tasks,
  we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, yielding superior
  performance. Furthermore, our approach enables the emergence of rich and diverse
  social behaviors among vehicles within the traffic flow.
