title: One-shot Imitation Learning via Interaction Warping
section: Poster
openreview: RaNAaxZfKi8
abstract: 'Learning robot policies from few demonstrations is crucial in open-ended
  applications. We propose a new method, Interaction Warping, for one-shot learning
  SE(3) robotic manipulation policies. We infer the 3D mesh of each object in the
  environment using shape warping, a technique for aligning point clouds across object
  instances. Then, we represent manipulation actions as keypoints on objects, which
  can be warped with the shape of the object. We show successful one-shot imitation
  learning on three simulated and real-world object re-arrangement tasks. We also
  demonstrate the ability of our method to predict object meshes and robot grasps
  in the wild. Webpage: https://shapewarping.github.io.'
