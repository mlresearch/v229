title: Finetuning Offline World Models in the Real World
section: Oral
openreview: JkFeyEC6VXV
abstract: 'Reinforcement Learning (RL) is notoriously data-inefficient, which makes
  training on a real robot difficult. While model-based RL algorithms (world models)
  improve data-efficiency to some extent, they still require hours or days of interaction
  to learn skills. Recently, offline RL has been proposed as a framework for training
  RL policies on pre-existing datasets without any online interaction. However, constraining
  an algorithm to a fixed dataset induces a state-action distribution shift between
  training and inference, and limits its applicability to new tasks. In this work,
  we seek to get the best of both worlds: we consider the problem of pretraining a
  world model with offline data collected on a real robot, and then finetuning the
  model on online data collected by planning with the learned model. To mitigate extrapolation
  errors during online interaction, we propose to regularize the planner at test-time
  by balancing estimated returns and (epistemic) model uncertainty. We evaluate our
  method on a variety of visuo-motor control tasks in simulation and on a real robot,
  and find that our method enables few-shot finetuning to seen and unseen tasks even
  when offline data is limited. Videos are available at https://yunhaifeng.com/FOWM'
