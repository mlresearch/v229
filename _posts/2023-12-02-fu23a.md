title: Batch Differentiable Pose Refinement for In-The-Wild Camera/LiDAR Extrinsic
  Calibration
section: Poster
openreview: mTZcxs2O7k
abstract: Accurate camera to LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) extrinsic calibration
  is important for robotic tasks carrying out tight sensor fusion — such as target
  tracking and odometry. Calibration is typically performed before deployment in controlled
  conditions using calibration targets, however, this limits scalability and subsequent
  recalibration. We propose a novel approach for target-free camera-LiDAR calibration
  using end-to-end direct alignment which doesn’t need calibration targets. Our batched
  formulation enhances sample efficiency during training and robustness at inference
  time. We present experimental results, on publicly available real-world data, demonstrating
  1.6cm/$0.07^{\circ}$ median accuracy when transferred to unseen sensors from held-out
  data sequences. We also show state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer to unseen cameras,
  LiDARs, and environments.
