title: Language Embedded Radiance Fields for Zero-Shot Task-Oriented Grasping
section: Oral
openreview: k-Fg8JDQmc
abstract: 'Grasping objects by a specific subpart is often crucial for safety and
  for executing downstream tasks. We propose LERF-TOGO, Language Embedded Radiance
  Fields for Task-Oriented Grasping of Objects, which uses vision-language models
  zero-shot to output a grasp distribution over an object given a natural language
  query. To accomplish this, we first construct a LERF of the scene, which distills
  CLIP embeddings into a multi-scale 3D language field queryable with text. However,
  LERF has no sense of object boundaries, so its relevancy outputs often return incomplete
  activations over an object which are insufficient for grasping. LERF-TOGO mitigates
  this lack of spatial grouping by extracting a 3D object mask via DINO features and
  then conditionally querying LERF on this mask to obtain a semantic distribution
  over the object to rank grasps from an off-the-shelf grasp planner. We evaluate
  LERF-TOGOâ€™s ability to grasp task-oriented object parts on 31 physical objects,
  and find it selects grasps on the correct part in $81%$ of trials and grasps successfully
  in $69%$. Code, data, appendix, and details are available at: lerftogo.github.io'
