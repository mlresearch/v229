title: Generalization of Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Policies via Awareness and Communication
  of Capabilities
section: Poster
openreview: N3VbFUpwaa
abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) are enabling
  impressive coordination in heterogeneous multi-robot teams. However, existing approaches
  often overlook the challenge of generalizing learned policies to teams of new compositions,
  sizes, and robots. While such generalization might not be important in teams of
  virtual agents that can retrain policies on-demand, it is pivotal in multi-robot
  systems that are deployed in the real-world and must readily adapt to inevitable
  changes. As such, multi-robot policies must remain robust to team changes â€“ an ability
  we call adaptive teaming. In this work, we investigate if awareness and communication
  of robot capabilities can provide such generalization by conducting detailed experiments
  involving an established multi-robot test bed. We demonstrate that shared decentralized
  policies, that enable robots to be both aware of and communicate their capabilities,
  can achieve adaptive teaming by implicitly capturing the fundamental relationship
  between collective capabilities and effective coordination. Videos of trained policies
