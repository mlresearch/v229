title: 'RoboPianist: Dexterous Piano Playing with Deep Reinforcement Learning'
section: Poster
openreview: HDYMjiukjn
abstract: Replicating human-like dexterity in robot hands represents one of the largest
  open problems in robotics. Reinforcement learning is a promising approach that has
  achieved impressive progress in the last few years; however, the class of problems
  it has typically addressed corresponds to a rather narrow definition of dexterity
  as compared to human capabilities. To address this gap, we investigate piano-playing,
  a skill that challenges even the human limits of dexterity, as a means to test high-dimensional
  control, and which requires high spatial and temporal precision, and complex finger
  coordination and planning. We introduce RoboPianist, a system that enables simulated
  anthropomorphic hands to learn an extensive repertoire of 150 piano pieces where
  traditional model-based optimization struggles. We additionally introduce an open-sourced
  environment, benchmark of tasks, interpretable evaluation metrics, and open challenges
  for future study. Our website featuring videos, code, and datasets is available
