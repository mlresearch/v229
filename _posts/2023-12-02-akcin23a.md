title: 'Fleet Active Learning: A Submodular Maximization Approach'
section: Poster
openreview: low-53sFqn
abstract: In multi-robot systems, robots often gather data to improve the performance
  of their deep neural networks (DNNs) for perception and planning. Ideally, these
  robots should select the most informative samples from their local data distributions
  by employing active learning approaches. However, when the data collection is distributed
  among multiple robots, redundancy becomes an issue as different robots may select
  similar data points. To overcome this challenge, we propose a fleet active learning
  (FAL) framework in which robots collectively select informative data samples to
  enhance their DNN models. Our framework leverages submodular maximization techniques
  to prioritize the selection of samples with high information gain. Through an iterative
  algorithm, the robots coordinate their efforts to collectively select the most valuable
  samples while minimizing communication between robots. We provide a theoretical
  analysis of the performance of our proposed framework and show that it is able to
  approximate the NP-hard optimal solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  framework through experiments on real-world perception and classification datasets,
  which include autonomous driving datasets such as Berkeley DeepDrive. Our results
  show an improvement by up to $25.0 %$ in classification accuracy, $9.2 %$ in mean
  average precision and $48.5 %$ in the submodular objective value compared to a completely
  distributed baseline.
