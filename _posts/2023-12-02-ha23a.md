title: 'Scaling Up and Distilling Down: Language-Guided Robot Skill Acquisition'
section: Poster
openreview: 3uwj8QZROL
abstract: We present a framework for robot skill acquisition, which 1) efficiently
  scale up data generation of language-labelled robot data and 2) effectively distills
  this data down into a robust multi-task language-conditioned visuo-motor policy.
  For (1), we use a large language model (LLM) to guide high-level planning, and sampling-based
  robot planners (e.g. motion or grasp samplers) for generating diverse and rich manipulation
  trajectories. To robustify this data-collection process, the LLM also infers a code-snippet
  for the success condition of each task, simultaneously enabling the data-collection
  process to detect failure and retry as well as the automatic labeling of trajectories
  with success/failure. For (2), we extend the diffusion policy single-task behavior-cloning
  approach to multi-task settings with language conditioning. Finally, we propose
  a new multi-task benchmark with 18 tasks across five domains to test long-horizon
  behavior, common-sense reasoning, tool-use, and intuitive physics. We find that
  our distilled policy successfully learned the robust retrying behavior in its data
  collection procedure, while improving absolute success rates by $33.2%$ on average
  across five domains. Code, data, and additional qualitative results are available
