title: Continual Vision-based Reinforcement Learning with Group Symmetries
section: Oral
openreview: flyQ0v8cgC
abstract: 'Continual reinforcement learning aims to sequentially learn a variety of
  tasks, retaining the ability to perform previously encountered tasks while simultaneously
  developing new policies for novel tasks. However, current continual RL approaches
  overlook the fact that certain tasks are identical under basic group operations
  like rotations or translations, especially with visual inputs. They may unnecessarily
  learn and maintain a new policy for each similar task, leading to poor sample efficiency
  and weak generalization capability. To address this, we introduce a unique Continual
  Vision-based Reinforcement Learning method that recognizes Group Symmetries, called
  COVERS, cultivating a policy for each group of equivalent tasks rather than an individual
  task. COVERS employs a proximal-policy-gradient-based (PPO-based) algorithm to train
  each policy, which contains an equivariant feature extractor and takes inputs with
  different modalities, including image observations and robot proprioceptive states.
  It also utilizes an unsupervised task grouping mechanism that relies on 1-Wasserstein
  distance on the extracted invariant features. We evaluate COVERS on a sequence of
  table-top manipulation tasks in simulation and on a real robot platform. Our results
  show that COVERS accurately assigns tasks to their respective groups and significantly
  outperforms baselines by generalizing to unseen but equivariant tasks in seen task
  groups. Demos are available on our project page: https://sites.google.com/view/rl-covers/.'
