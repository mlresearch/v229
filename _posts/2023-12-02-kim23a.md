title: Leveraging 3D Reconstruction for Mechanical Search on Cluttered Shelves
section: Poster
openreview: ycy47ZX0Oc
abstract: 'Finding and grasping a target object on a cluttered shelf, especially when
  the target is occluded by other unknown objects and initially invisible, remains
  a significant challenge in robotic manipulation. While there have been advances
  in finding the target object by rearranging surrounding objects using specialized
  tools, developing algorithms that work with standard robot grippers remains an unresolved
  issue. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for finding and grasping the
  target object using a standard gripper, employing pushing and pick and-place actions.
  To achieve this, we introduce two indicator functions: (i) an existence function,
  determining the potential presence of the target, and (ii) a graspability function,
  assessing the feasibility of grasping the identified target. We then formulate a
  model-based optimal control problem. The core component of our approach involves
  leveraging a 3D recognition model, enabling efficient estimation of the proposed
  indicator functions and their associated dynamics models. Our method succeeds in
  finding and grasping the target object using a standard robot gripper in both simulations
  and real-world settings. In particular, we demonstrate the adaptability and robustness
  of our method in the presence of noise in real-world vision sensor data. The code
  for our framework is available at https://github.com/seungyeon-k/Search-for-Grasp-public.'
