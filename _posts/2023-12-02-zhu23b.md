title: Learning Generalizable Manipulation Policies with Object-Centric 3D Representations
section: Poster
openreview: 9SM6l0HyY_
abstract: We introduce GROOT, an imitation learning method for learning robust policies
  with object-centric and 3D priors. GROOT builds policies that generalize beyond
  their initial training conditions for vision-based manipulation. It constructs object-centric
  3D representations that are robust toward background changes and camera views and
  reason over these representations using a transformer-based policy. Furthermore,
  we introduce a segmentation correspondence model that allows policies to generalize
  to new objects at test time. Through comprehensive experiments, we validate the
  robustness of GROOT policies against perceptual variations in simulated and real-world
  environments. GROOTâ€™s performance excels in generalization over background changes,
  camera viewpoint shifts, and the presence of new object instances, whereas both
  state-of-the-art end-to-end learning methods and object proposal-based approaches
  fall short. We also extensively evaluate GROOT policies on real robots, where we
  demonstrate the efficacy under very wild changes in setup. More videos and model
  details can be found in the appendix and the project website https://ut-austin-rpl.github.io/GROOT.
