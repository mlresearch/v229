title: 'PlayFusion: Skill Acquisition via Diffusion from Language-Annotated Play'
section: Poster
openreview: afF8RGcBBP
abstract: Learning from unstructured and uncurated data has become the dominant paradigm
  for generative approaches in language or vision. Such unstructured and unguided
  behavior data, commonly known as play, is also easier to collect in robotics but
  much more difficult to learn from due to its inherently multimodal, noisy, and suboptimal
  nature. In this paper, we study this problem of learning goal-directed skill policies
  from unstructured play data which is labeled with language in hindsight. Specifically,
  we leverage advances in diffusion models to learn a multi-task diffusion model to
  extract robotic skills from play data. Using a conditional denoising diffusion process
  in the space of states and actions, we can gracefully handle the complexity and
  multimodality of play data and generate diverse and interesting robot behaviors.
  To make diffusion models more useful for skill learning, we encourage robotic agents
  to acquire a vocabulary of skills by introducing discrete bottlenecks into the conditional
  behavior generation process. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our approach across a wide variety of environments in both simulation and the
  real world. Video results available at https://play-fusion.github.io.
