title: 'SayTap: Language to Quadrupedal Locomotion'
section: Poster
openreview: 7TYeO2XVqI
abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the potential to perform
  high-level planning. Yet, it remains a challenge for LLMs to comprehend low-level
  commands, such as joint angle targets or motor torques. This paper proposes an approach
  to use foot contact patterns as an interface that bridges human commands in natural
  language and a locomotion controller that outputs these low-level commands. This
  results in an interactive system for quadrupedal robots that allows the users to
  craft diverse locomotion behaviors flexibly. We contribute an LLM prompt design,
  a reward function, and a method to expose the controller to the feasible distribution
  of contact patterns. The results are a controller capable of achieving diverse locomotion
  patterns that can be transferred to real robot hardware. Compared with other design
  choices, the proposed approach enjoys more than $50%$ success rate in predicting
  the correct contact patterns and can solve 10 more tasks out of a total of 30 tasks.
