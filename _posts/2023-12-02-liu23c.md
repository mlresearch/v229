title: 'CLUE: Calibrated Latent Guidance for Offline Reinforcement Learning'
section: Poster
openreview: xJ7XL5Wt8iN
abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn an optimal policy from
  pre-collected and labeled datasets, which eliminates the time-consuming data collection
  in online RL. However, offline RL still bears a large burden of specifying/handcrafting
  extrinsic rewards for each transition in the offline data. As a remedy for the labor-intensive
  labeling, we propose to endow offline RL tasks with a few expert data and utilize
  the limited expert data to drive intrinsic rewards, thus eliminating the need for
  extrinsic rewards. To achieve that, we introduce Calibrated Latent gUidancE (CLUE),
  which utilizes a conditional variational auto-encoder to learn a latent space such
  that intrinsic rewards can be directly qualified over the latent space. CLUEâ€™s key
  idea is to align the intrinsic rewards consistent with the expert intention via
  enforcing the embeddings of expert data to a calibrated contextual representation.
  We instantiate the expert-driven intrinsic rewards in sparse-reward offline RL tasks,
  offline imitation learning (IL) tasks, and unsupervised offline RL tasks. Empirically,
  we find that CLUE can effectively improve the sparse-reward offline RL performance,
  outperform the state-of-the-art offline IL baselines, and discover diverse skills
  from static reward-free offline data.
