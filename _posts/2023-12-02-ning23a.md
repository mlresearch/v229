title: Scalable Deep Kernel Gaussian Process for Vehicle Dynamics in Autonomous Racing
section: Poster
openreview: zUiH8UUYDo
abstract: Autonomous racing presents a challenging environment for testing the limits
  of autonomous vehicle technology. Accurately modeling the vehicle dynamics (with
  all forces and tires) is critical for high-speed racing, but it remains a difficult
  task and requires an intricate balance between run-time computational demands and
  modeling complexity. Researchers have proposed utilizing learning-based methods
  such as Gaussian Process (GP) for learning vehicle dynamics. However, current approaches
  often oversimplify the modeling process or apply strong assumptions, leading to
  unrealistic results that cannot translate to real-world settings. In this paper,
  we proposed DKL-SKIP method for vehicle dynamics modeling. Our approach outperforms
  standard GP methods and the N4SID system identification technique in terms of prediction
  accuracy. In addition to evaluating DKL-SKIP on real-world data, we also evaluate
  its performance using a high-fidelity autonomous racing AutoVerse simulator. The
  results highlight the potential of DKL-SKIP as a promising tool for modeling complex
  vehicle dynamics in both real-world and simulated environments.
