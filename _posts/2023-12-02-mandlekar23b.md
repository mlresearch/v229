title: Human-in-the-Loop Task and Motion Planning for Imitation Learning
section: Poster
openreview: G_FEL3OkiR
abstract: Imitation learning from human demonstrations can teach robots complex manipulation
  skills, but is time-consuming and labor intensive. In contrast, Task and Motion
  Planning (TAMP) systems are automated and excel at solving long-horizon tasks, but
  they are difficult to apply to contact-rich tasks. In this paper, we present Human-in-the-Loop
  Task and Motion Planning (HITL-TAMP), a novel system that leverages the benefits
  of both approaches. The system employs a TAMP-gated control mechanism, which selectively
  gives and takes control to and from a human teleoperator. This enables the human
  teleoperator to manage a fleet of robots, maximizing data collection efficiency.
  The collected human data is then combined with an imitation learning framework to
  train a TAMP-gated policy, leading to superior performance compared to training
  on full task demonstrations. We compared HITL-TAMP to a conventional teleoperation
  system â€” users gathered more than 3x the number of demos given the same time budget.
  Furthermore, proficient agents ($75%$+ success) could be trained from just 10 minutes
  of non-expert teleoperation data. Finally, we collected 2.1K demos with HITL-TAMP
  across 12 contact-rich, long-horizon tasks and show that the system often produces
  near-perfect agents. Videos and additional results at https://hitltamp.github.io
