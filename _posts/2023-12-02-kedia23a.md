title: 'ManiCast: Collaborative Manipulation with Cost-Aware Human Forecasting'
section: Poster
openreview: rxlokRzNWRq
abstract: Seamless human-robot manipulation in close proximity relies on accurate
  forecasts of human motion. While there has been significant progress in learning
  forecast models at scale, when applied to manipulation tasks, these models accrue
  high errors at critical transition points leading to degradation in downstream planning
  performance. Our key insight is that instead of predicting the most likely human
  motion, it is sufficient to produce forecasts that capture how future human motion
  would affect the cost of a robotâ€™s plan. We present ManiCast, a novel framework
  that learns cost-aware human forecasts and feeds them to a model predictive control
  planner to execute collaborative manipulation tasks. Our framework enables fluid,
  real-time interactions between a human and a 7-DoF robot arm across a number of
  real-world tasks such as reactive stirring, object handovers, and collaborative
  table setting. We evaluate both the motion forecasts and the end-to-end forecaster-planner
  system against a range of learned and heuristic baselines while additionally contributing
  new datasets. We release our code and datasets at https://portal-cornell.github.io/manicast/.
