title: Equivariant Reinforcement Learning under Partial Observability
section: Poster
openreview: AnDDMQgM7-
abstract: Incorporating inductive biases is a promising approach for tackling challenging
  robot learning domains with sample-efficient solutions. This paper identifies partially
  observable domains where symmetries can be a useful inductive bias for efficient
  learning. Specifically, by encoding the equivariance regarding specific group symmetries
  into the neural networks, our actor-critic reinforcement learning agents can reuse
  solutions in the past for related scenarios. Consequently, our equivariant agents
  outperform non-equivariant approaches significantly in terms of sample efficiency
  and final performance, demonstrated through experiments on a range of robotic tasks
  in simulation and real hardware.
