title: 'IIFL: Implicit Interactive Fleet Learning from Heterogeneous Human Supervisors'
section: Poster
openreview: VtUZ4VGPns
abstract: Imitation learning has been applied to a range of robotic tasks, but can
  struggle when robots encounter edge cases that are not represented in the training
  data (i.e., distribution shift). Interactive fleet learning (IFL) mitigates distribution
  shift by allowing robots to access remote human supervisors during task execution
  and learn from them over time, but different supervisors may demonstrate the task
  in different ways. Recent work proposes Implicit Behavior Cloning (IBC), which is
  able to represent multimodal demonstrations using energy-based models (EBMs). In
  this work, we propose Implicit Interactive Fleet Learning (IIFL), an algorithm that
  builds on IBC for interactive imitation learning from multiple heterogeneous human
  supervisors. A key insight in IIFL is a novel approach for uncertainty quantification
  in EBMs using Jeffreys divergence. While IIFL is more computationally expensive
  than explicit methods, results suggest that IIFL achieves a 2.8x higher success
  rate in simulation experiments and a 4.5x higher return on human effort in a physical
  block pushing task over (Explicit) IFL, IBC, and other baselines.
