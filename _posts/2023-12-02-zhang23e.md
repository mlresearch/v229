title: Efficient Sim-to-real Transfer of Contact-Rich Manipulation Skills with Online
  Admittance Residual Learning
section: Poster
openreview: gFXVysXh48K
abstract: Learning contact-rich manipulation skills is essential. Such skills require
  the robots to interact with the environment with feasible manipulation trajectories
  and suitable compliance control parameters to enable safe and stable contact. However,
  learning these skills is challenging due to data inefficiency in the real world
  and the sim-to-real gap in simulation. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid offline-online
  framework to learn robust manipulation skills. We employ model-free reinforcement
  learning for the offline phase to obtain the robot motion and compliance control
  parameters in simulation \RV{with domain randomization}. Subsequently, in the online
  phase, we learn the residual of the compliance control parameters to maximize robot
  performance-related criteria with force sensor measurements in real-time. To demonstrate
  the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, we provide comparative results
  against existing methods for assembly, pivoting, and screwing tasks.
