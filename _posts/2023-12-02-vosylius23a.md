title: Few-Shot In-Context Imitation Learning via Implicit Graph Alignment
section: Poster
openreview: CnKf9TyYtf2
abstract: 'Consider the following problem: given a few demonstrations of a task across
  a few different objects, how can a robot learn to perform that same task on new,
  previously unseen objects? This is challenging because the large variety of objects
  within a class makes it difficult to infer the task-relevant relationship between
  the new objects and the objects in the demonstrations. We address this by formulating
  imitation learning as a conditional alignment problem between graph representations
  of objects. Consequently, we show that this conditioning allows for in-context learning,
  where a robot can perform a task on a set of new objects immediately after the demonstrations,
  without any prior knowledge about the object class or any further training. In our
  experiments, we explore and validate our design choices, and we show that our method
  is highly effective for few-shot learning of several real-world, everyday tasks,
  whilst outperforming baselines. Videos are available on our project webpage at https://www.robot-learning.uk/implicit-graph-alignment.'
