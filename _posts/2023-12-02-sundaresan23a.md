title: 'KITE: Keypoint-Conditioned Policies for Semantic Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: veGdf4L4Xz
abstract: 'While natural language offers a convenient shared interface for humans
  and robots, enabling robots to interpret and follow language commands remains a
  longstanding challenge in manipulation. A crucial step to realizing a performant
  instruction-following robot is achieving semantic manipulation â€“ where a robot interprets
  language at different specificities, from high-level instructions like "Pick up
  the stuffed animal" to more detailed inputs like "Grab the left ear of the elephant."
  To tackle this, we propose Keypoints + Instructions to Execution, a two-step framework
  for semantic manipulation which attends to both scene semantics (distinguishing
  between different objects in a visual scene) and object semantics (precisely localizing
  different parts within an object instance). KITE first grounds an input instruction
  in a visual scene through 2D image keypoints, providing a highly accurate object-centric
  bias for downstream action inference. Provided an RGB-D scene observation, KITE
  then executes a learned keypoint-conditioned skill to carry out the instruction.
  The combined precision of keypoints and parameterized skills enables fine-grained
  manipulation with generalization to scene and object variations. Empirically, we
  demonstrate KITE in 3 real-world environments: long-horizon 6-DoF tabletop manipulation,
  semantic grasping, and a high-precision coffee-making task. In these settings, KITE
  achieves a $75%$, $70%$, and $71%$ overall success rate for instruction-following,
  respectively. KITE outperforms frameworks that opt for pre-trained visual language
  models over keypoint-based grounding, or omit skills in favor of end-to-end visuomotor
  control, all while being trained from fewer or comparable amounts of demonstrations.
