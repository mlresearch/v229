title: Semantic Mechanical Search with Large Vision and Language Models
section: Poster
openreview: vsEWu6mMUhB
abstract: Moving objects to find a fully-occluded target object, known as mechanical
  search, is a challenging problem in robotics. As objects are often organized semantically,
  we conjecture that semantic information about object relationships can facilitate
  mechanical search and reduce search time. Large pretrained vision and language models
  (VLMs and LLMs) have shown promise in generalizing to uncommon objects and previously
  unseen real-world environments. In this work, we propose a novel framework called
  Semantic Mechanical Search (SMS). SMS conducts scene understanding and generates
  a semantic occupancy distribution explicitly using LLMs. Compared to methods that
  rely on visual similarities offered by CLIP embeddings, SMS leverages the deep reasoning
  capabilities of LLMs. Unlike prior work that uses VLMs and LLMs as end-to-end planners,
  which may not integrate well with specialized geometric planners, SMS can serve
  as a plug-in semantic module for downstream manipulation or navigation policies.
  For mechanical search in closed-world settings such as shelves, we compare with
  a geometric-based planner and show that SMS improves mechanical search performance
  by $24%$ across the pharmacy, kitchen, and office domains in simulation and $47.1%$
  in physical experiments. For open-world real environments, SMS can produce better
  semantic distributions compared to CLIP-based methods, with the potential to be
  integrated with downstream navigation policies to improve object navigation tasks.
