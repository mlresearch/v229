title: 'NOIR: Neural Signal Operated Intelligent Robots for Everyday Activities'
section: Poster
openreview: eyykI3UIHa
abstract: We present Neural Signal Operated Intelligent Robots (NOIR), a general-purpose,
  intelligent brain-robot interface system that enables humans to command robots to
  perform everyday activities through brain signals. Through this interface, humans
  communicate their intended objects of interest and actions to the robots using electroencephalography
  (EEG). Our novel system demonstrates success in an expansive array of 20 challenging,
  everyday household activities, including cooking, cleaning, personal care, and entertainment.
  The effectiveness of the system is improved by its synergistic integration of robot
  learning algorithms, allowing for NOIR to adapt to individual users and predict
  their intentions. Our work enhances the way humans interact with robots, replacing
  traditional channels of interaction with direct, neural communication.
