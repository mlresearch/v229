title: Marginalized Importance Sampling for Off-Environment Policy Evaluation
section: Poster
openreview: 32c8pl84_uD
abstract: 'Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods are typically sample-inefficient, making
  it challenging to train and deploy RL-policies in real world robots. Even a robust
  policy trained in simulation requires a real-world deployment to assess their performance.
  This paper proposes a new approach to evaluate the real-world performance of agent
  policies prior to deploying them in the real world. Our approach incorporates a
  simulator along with real-world offline data to evaluate the performance of any
  policy using the framework of Marginalized Importance Sampling (MIS). Existing MIS
  methods face two challenges: (1) large density ratios that deviate from a reasonable
  range and (2) indirect supervision, where the ratio needs to be inferred indirectly,
  thus exacerbating estimation error. Our approach addresses these challenges by introducing
  the target policyâ€™s occupancy in the simulator as an intermediate variable and learning
  the density ratio as the product of two terms that can be learned separately. The
  first term is learned with direct supervision and the second term has a small magnitude,
  thus making it computationally efficient. We analyze the sample complexity as well
  as error propagation of our two step-procedure. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate
  our approach on Sim2Sim environments such as Cartpole, Reacher, and Half-Cheetah.
  Our results show that our method generalizes well across a variety of Sim2Sim gap,
  target policies and offline data collection policies. We also demonstrate the performance
  of our algorithm on a Sim2Real task of validating the performance of a 7 DoF robotic
  arm using offline data along with the Gazebo simulator.'
