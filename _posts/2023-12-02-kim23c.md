title: 'Transforming a Quadruped into a Guide Robot for the Visually Impaired: Formalizing
  Wayfinding, Interaction Modeling, and Safety Mechanism'
section: Poster
openreview: W7eg2NqFJ60
abstract: 'This paper explores the principles for transforming a quadrupedal robot
  into a guide robot for individuals with visual impairments. A guide robot has great
  potential to resolve the limited availability of guide animals that are accessible
  to only two to three percent of the potential blind or visually impaired (BVI) users.
  To build a successful guide robot, our paper explores three key topics: (1) formalizing
  the navigation mechanism of a guide dog and a human, (2) developing a data-driven
  model of their interaction, and (3) improving user safety. First, we formalize the
  wayfinding task of the human-guide robot team using Markov Decision Processes based
  on the literature and interviews. Then we collect real human-robot interaction data
  from three visually impaired and six sighted people and develop an interaction model
  called the "Delayed Harness" to effectively simulate the navigation behaviors of
  the team. Additionally, we introduce an action shielding mechanism to enhance user
  safety by predicting and filtering out dangerous actions. We evaluate the developed
  interaction model and the safety mechanism in simulation, which greatly reduce the
  prediction errors and the number of collisions, respectively. We also demonstrate
  the integrated system on an AlienGo robot with a rigid harness, by guiding users
  over 100+ meter trajectories.'
