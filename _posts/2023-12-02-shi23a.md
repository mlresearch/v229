title: 'RoboCook: Long-Horizon Elasto-Plastic Object Manipulation with Diverse Tools'
section: Oral
openreview: 69y5fzvaAT
abstract: 'Humans excel in complex long-horizon soft body manipulation tasks via flexible
  tool use: bread baking requires a knife to slice the dough and a rolling pin to
  flatten it. Often regarded as a hallmark of human cognition, tool use in autonomous
  robots remains limited due to challenges in understanding tool-object interactions.
  Here we develop an intelligent robotic system, RoboCook, which perceives, models,
  and manipulates elasto-plastic objects with various tools. RoboCook uses point cloud
  scene representations, models tool-object interactions with Graph Neural Networks
  (GNNs), and combines tool classification with self-supervised policy learning to
  devise manipulation plans. We demonstrate that from just 20 minutes of real-world
  interaction data per tool, a general-purpose robot arm can learn complex long-horizon
  soft object manipulation tasks, such as making dumplings and alphabet letter cookies.
  Extensive evaluations show that RoboCook substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
  approaches, exhibits robustness against severe external disturbances, and demonstrates
  adaptability to different materials.'
