title: 'PairwiseNet: Pairwise Collision Distance Learning for High-dof Robot Systems'
section: Poster
openreview: Id4b5SY1Y8
abstract: Motion planning for robot manipulation systems operating in complex environments
  remains a challenging problem. It requires the evaluation of both the collision
  distance and its derivative. Owing to its computational complexity, recent studies
  have attempted to utilize data-driven approaches to learn the collision distance.
  However, their performance degrades significantly for complicated high-dof systems,
  such as multi-arm robots. Additionally, the model must be retrained every time the
  environment undergoes even slight changes. In this paper, we propose PairwiseNet,
  a model that estimates the minimum distance between two geometric shapes and overcomes
  many of the limitations of current models. By dividing the problem of global collision
  distance learning into smaller pairwise sub-problems, PairwiseNet can be used to
  efficiently calculate the global collision distance. PairwiseNet can be deployed
  without further modifications or training for any system comprised of the same shape
  elements (as those in the training dataset). Experiments with multi-arm manipulation
  systems of various dof indicate that our model achieves significant performance
  improvements concerning several performance metrics, especially the false positive
  rate with the collision-free guaranteed threshold. Results further demonstrate that
  our single trained PairwiseNet model is applicable to all multi-arm systems used
  in the evaluation. The code is available at https://github.com/kjh6526/PairwiseNet.
