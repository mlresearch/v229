title: Surrogate Assisted Generation of Human-Robot Interaction Scenarios
section: Oral
openreview: C5MQUlzhVjQ
abstract: As human-robot interaction (HRI) systems advance, so does the difficulty
  of evaluating and understanding the strengths and limitations of these systems in
  different environments and with different users. To this end, previous methods have
  algorithmically generated diverse scenarios that reveal system failures in a shared
  control teleoperation task. However, these methods require directly evaluating generated
  scenarios by simulating robot policies and human actions. The computational cost
  of these evaluations limits their applicability in more complex domains. Thus, we
  propose augmenting scenario generation systems with surrogate models that predict
  both human and robot behaviors. In the shared control teleoperation domain and a
  more complex shared workspace collaboration task, we show that surrogate assisted
  scenario generation efficiently synthesizes diverse datasets of challenging scenarios.
  We demonstrate that these failures are reproducible in real-world interactions.
