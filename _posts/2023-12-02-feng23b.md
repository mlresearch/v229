title: Topology-Matching Normalizing Flows for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Robot
  Learning
section: Poster
openreview: BzjLaVvr955
abstract: To facilitate reliable deployments of autonomous robots in the real world,
  Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection capabilities are often required. A powerful
  approach for OOD detection is based on density estimation with Normalizing Flows
  (NFs). However, we find that prior work with NFs attempts to match the complex target
  distribution topologically with naïve base distributions leading to adverse implications.
  In this work, we circumvent this topological mismatch using an expressive class-conditional
  base distribution trained with an information-theoretic objective to match the required
  topology. The proposed method enjoys the merits of wide compatibility with existing
  learned models without any performance degradation and minimum computation overhead
  while enhancing OOD detection capabilities. We demonstrate superior results in density
  estimation and 2D object detection benchmarks in comparison with extensive baselines.
  Moreover, we showcase the applicability of the method with a real-robot deployment.
