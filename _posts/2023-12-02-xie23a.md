title: Stochastic Occupancy Grid Map Prediction in Dynamic Scenes
section: Poster
openreview: fSmkKmWM5Ry
abstract: This paper presents two variations of a novel stochastic prediction algorithm
  that enables mobile robots to accurately and robustly predict the future state of
  complex dynamic scenes. The proposed algorithm uses a variational autoencoder to
  predict a range of possible future states of the environment. The algorithm takes
  full advantage of the motion of the robot itself, the motion of dynamic objects,
  and the geometry of static objects in the scene to improve prediction accuracy.
  Three simulated and real-world datasets collected by different robot models are
  used to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve more accurate
  and robust prediction performance than other prediction algorithms. Furthermore,
  a predictive uncertainty-aware planner is proposed to demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed predictor in simulation and real-world navigation experiments. Implementations
  are open source at https://github.com/TempleRAIL/SOGMP.
