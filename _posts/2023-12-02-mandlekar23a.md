title: 'MimicGen: A Data Generation System for Scalable Robot Learning using Human
  Demonstrations'
section: Poster
openreview: dk-2R1f_LR
abstract: Imitation learning from a large set of human demonstrations has proved to
  be an effective paradigm for building capable robot agents. However, the demonstrations
  can be extremely costly and time-consuming to collect. We introduce MimicGen, a
  system for automatically synthesizing large-scale, rich datasets from only a small
  number of human demonstrations by adapting them to new contexts. We use MimicGen
  to generate over 50K demonstrations across 18 tasks with diverse scene configurations,
  object instances, and robot arms from just Â 200 human demonstrations. We show that
  robot agents can be effectively trained on this generated dataset by imitation learning
  to achieve strong performance in long-horizon and high-precision tasks, such as
  multi-part assembly and coffee preparation, across broad initial state distributions.
  We further demonstrate that the effectiveness and utility of MimicGen data compare
  favorably to collecting additional human demonstrations, making it a powerful and
  economical approach towards scaling up robot learning. Datasets, simulation environments,
  videos, and more at https://mimicgen.github.io.
