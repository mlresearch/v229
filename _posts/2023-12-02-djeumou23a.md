title: 'How to Learn and Generalize From Three Minutes of Data: Physics-Constrained
  and Uncertainty-Aware Neural Stochastic Differential Equations'
section: Oral
openreview: 770xKAHeFS
abstract: 'We present a framework and algorithms to learn controlled dynamics models
  using neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs)—SDEs whose drift and diffusion
  terms are both parametrized by neural networks. We construct the drift term to leverage
  a priori physics knowledge as inductive bias, and we design the diffusion term to
  represent a distance-aware estimate of the uncertainty in the learned model’s predictions—it
  matches the system’s underlying stochasticity when evaluated on states near those
  from the training dataset, and it predicts highly stochastic dynamics when evaluated
  on states beyond the training regime. The proposed neural SDEs can be evaluated
  quickly enough for use in model predictive control algorithms, or they can be used
  as simulators for model-based reinforcement learning. Furthermore, they make accurate
  predictions over long time horizons, even when trained on small datasets that cover
  limited regions of the state space. We demonstrate these capabilities through experiments
  on simulated robotic systems, as well as by using them to model and control a hexacopter’s
  flight dynamics: A neural SDE trained using only three minutes of manually collected
  flight data results in a model-based control policy that accurately tracks aggressive
  trajectories that push the hexacopter’s velocity and Euler angles to nearly double
  the maximum values observed in the training dataset.'
