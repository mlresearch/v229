title: 'Stabilize to Act: Learning to Coordinate for Bimanual Manipulation'
section: Oral
openreview: 86aMPJn6hX9F
abstract: 'Key to rich, dexterous manipulation in the real world is the ability to
  coordinate control across two hands. However, while the promise afforded by bimanual
  robotic systems is immense, constructing control policies for dual arm autonomous
  systems brings inherent difficulties. One such difficulty is the high-dimensionality
  of the bimanual action space, which adds complexity to both model-based and data-driven
  methods. We counteract this challenge by drawing inspiration from humans to propose
  a novel role assignment framework: a stabilizing arm holds an object in place to
  simplify the environment while an acting arm executes the task. We instantiate this
  framework with BimanUal Dexterity from Stabilization (BUDS), which uses a learned
  restabilizing classifier to alternate between updating a learned stabilization position
  to keep the environment unchanged, and accomplishing the task with an acting policy
  learned from demonstrations. We evaluate BUDS on four bimanual tasks of varying
  complexities on real-world robots, such as zipping jackets and cutting vegetables.
  Given only 20 demonstrations, BUDS achieves $76.9%$ task success across our task
  suite, and generalizes to out-of-distribution objects within a class with a $52.7%$
  success rate. BUDS is $56.0%$ more successful than an unstructured baseline that
  instead learns a BC stabilizing policy due to the precision required of these complex
  tasks. Supplementary material and videos can be found at https://tinyurl.com/stabilizetoact.'
