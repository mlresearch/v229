title: Geometry Matching for Multi-Embodiment Grasping
section: Poster
openreview: oyWkrG-LD5
abstract: While significant progress has been made on the problem of generating grasps,
  many existing learning-based approaches still concentrate on a single embodiment,
  provide limited generalization to higher DoF end-effectors and cannot capture a
  diverse set of grasp modes. In this paper, we tackle the problem of grasping multi-embodiments
  through the viewpoint of learning rich geometric representations for both objects
  and end-effectors using Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Our novel method – GeoMatch
  – applies supervised learning on grasping data from multiple embodiments, learning
  end-to-end contact point likelihood maps as well as conditional autoregressive prediction
  of grasps keypoint-by-keypoint. We compare our method against 3 baselines that provide
  multi-embodiment support. Our approach performs better across 3 end-effectors, while
  also providing competitive diversity of grasps. Examples can be found at geomatch.github.io.
