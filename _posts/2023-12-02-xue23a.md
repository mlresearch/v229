title: Neural Field Dynamics Model for Granular Object Piles Manipulation
section: Poster
openreview: K8cGp8rVLIP
abstract: We present a learning-based dynamics model for granular material manipulation.
  Drawing inspiration from computer graphicsâ€™ Eulerian approach, our method adopts
  a fully convolutional neural network that operates on a density field-based representation
  of object piles, allowing it to exploit the spatial locality of inter-object interactions
  through the convolution operations. This approach greatly improves the learning
  and computation efficiency compared to existing latent or particle-based methods
  and sidesteps the need for state estimation, making it directly applicable to real-world
  settings. Furthermore, our differentiable action rendering module makes the model
  fully differentiable and can be directly integrated with a gradient-based algorithm
  for curvilinear trajectory optimization. We evaluate our model with a wide array
  of piles manipulation tasks both in simulation and real-world experiments and demonstrate
  that it significantly exceeds existing methods in both accuracy and computation
  efficiency. More details can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/nfd-corl23/
