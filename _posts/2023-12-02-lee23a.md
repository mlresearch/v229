title: Equivariant Motion Manifold Primitives
section: Poster
openreview: psyvs5wdAV
abstract: Existing movement primitive models for the most part focus on representing
  and generating a single trajectory for a given task, limiting their adaptability
  to situations in which unforeseen obstacles or new constraints may arise. In this
  work we propose Motion Manifold Primitives (MMP), a movement primitive paradigm
  that encodes and generates, for a given task, a continuous manifold of trajectories
  each of which can achieve the given task. To address the challenge of learning each
  motion manifold from a limited amount of data, we exploit inherent symmetries in
  the robot task by constructing motion manifold primitives that are equivariant with
  respect to given symmetry groups. Under the assumption that each of the MMPs can
  be smoothly deformed into each other, an autoencoder framework is developed to encode
  the MMPs and also generate solution trajectories. Experiments involving synthetic
  and real-robot examples demonstrate that our method outperforms existing manifold
  primitive methods by significant margins. Code is available at https://github.com/dlsfldl/EMMP-public.
