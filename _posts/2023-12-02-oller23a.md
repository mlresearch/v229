title: 'TactileVAD: Geometric Aliasing-Aware Dynamics for High-Resolution Tactile
  Control'
section: Poster
openreview: FefFLN5FvIM
abstract: Touch-based control is a promising approach to dexterous manipulation. However,
  existing tactile control methods often overlook tactile geometric aliasing which
  can compromise control performance and reliability. This type of aliasing occurs
  when different contact locations yield similar tactile signatures. To address this,
  we propose TactileVAD, a generative decoder-only linear latent dynamics formulation
  compatible with standard control methods that is capable of resolving geometric
  aliasing. We evaluate TactileVAD on two mechanically-distinct tactile sensors, SoftBubbles
  (pointcloud data) and Gelslim 3.0 (RGB data), showcasing its effectiveness in handling
  different sensing modalities. Additionally, we introduce the tactile cartpole, a
  novel benchmarking setup to evaluate the ability of a control method to respond
  to disturbances based on tactile input. Evaluations comparing TactileVAD to baselines
  suggest that our method is better able to achieve goal tactile configurations and
  hand poses.
