abstract: Trajectory prediction modules are key enablers for safe and efficient planning
  of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in highly interactive traffic scenarios.
  Recently, learning-based trajectory predictors have experienced considerable success
  in providing state-of-the-art performance due to their ability to learn multimodal
  behaviors of other agents from data. In this paper, we present an algorithm called
  multi-predictor fusion (MPF) that augments the performance of learning-based predictors
  by imbuing them with motion planners that are tasked with satisfying logic-based
  rules. MPF probabilistically combines learning- and rule-based predictors by mixing
  trajectories from both standalone predictors in accordance with a belief distribution
  that reflects the online performance of each predictor. In our results, we show
  that MPF outperforms the two standalone predictors on various metrics and delivers
  the most consistent performance.
