title: 'REFLECT: Summarizing Robot Experiences for Failure Explanation and Correction'
section: Poster
openreview: 8yTS_nAILxt
abstract: The ability to detect and analyze failed executions automatically is crucial
  for an explainable and robust robotic system. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
  have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities on textual inputs. To leverage the
  power of LLMs for robot failure explanation, we introduce REFLECT, a framework which
  queries LLM for failure reasoning based on a hierarchical summary of robot past
  experiences generated from multisensory observations. The failure explanation can
  further guide a language-based planner to correct the failure and complete the task.
  To systematically evaluate the framework, we create the RoboFail dataset with a
  variety of tasks and failure scenarios. We demonstrate that the LLM-based framework
  is able to generate informative failure explanations that assist successful correction
  planning.
