title: 'HACMan: Learning Hybrid Actor-Critic Maps for 6D Non-Prehensile Manipulation'
section: Oral
openreview: fa7FzDjhzs9
abstract: 'Manipulating objects without grasping them is an essential component of
  human dexterity, referred to as non-prehensile manipulation. Non-prehensile manipulation
  may enable more complex interactions with the objects, but also presents challenges
  in reasoning about gripper-object interactions. In this work, we introduce Hybrid
  Actor-Critic Maps for Manipulation (HACMan), a reinforcement learning approach for
  6D non-prehensile manipulation of objects using point cloud observations. HACMan
  proposes a temporally-abstracted and spatially-grounded object-centric action representation
  that consists of selecting a contact location from the object point cloud and a
  set of motion parameters describing how the robot will move after making contact.
  We modify an existing off-policy RL algorithm to learn in this hybrid discrete-continuous
  action representation. We evaluate HACMan on a 6D object pose alignment task in
  both simulation and in the real world. On the hardest version of our task, with
  randomized initial poses, randomized 6D goals, and diverse object categories, our
  policy demonstrates strong generalization to unseen object categories without a
  performance drop, achieving an $89%$ success rate on unseen objects in simulation
  and $50%$ success rate with zero-shot transfer in the real world. Compared to alternative
  action representations, HACMan achieves a success rate more than three times higher
  than the best baseline. With zero-shot sim2real transfer, our policy can successfully
  manipulate unseen objects in the real world for challenging non-planar goals, using
  dynamic and contact-rich non-prehensile skills. Videos can be found on the project
