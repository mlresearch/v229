title: Towards General Single-Utensil Food Acquisition with Human-Informed Actions
section: Poster
openreview: UZpWSDA3tZJ
abstract: Food acquisition with common general-purpose utensils is a necessary component
  of robot applications like in-home assistive feeding. Learning acquisition policies
  in this space is difficult in part because any model will need to contend with extensive
  state and actions spaces. Food is extremely diverse and generally difficult to simulate,
  and acquisition actions like skewers, scoops, wiggles, and twirls can be parameterized
  in myriad ways. However, foodâ€™s visual diversity can belie a degree of physical
  homogeneity, and many foods allow flexibility in how they are acquired. Due to these
  facts, our key insight is that a small subset of actions is sufficient to acquire
  a wide variety of food items. In this work, we present a methodology for identifying
  such a subset from limited human trajectory data. We first develop an over-parameterized
  action space of robot acquisition trajectories that capture the variety of human
  food acquisition technique. By mapping human trajectories into this space and clustering,
  we construct a discrete set of 11 actions. We demonstrate that this set is capable
  of acquiring a variety of food items with $\geq80%$ success rate, a rate that users
  have said is sufficient for in-home robot-assisted feeding. Furthermore, since this
  set is so small, we also show that we can use online learning to determine a sufficiently
  optimal action for a previously-unseen food item over the course of a single meal.
