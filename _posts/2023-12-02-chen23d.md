title: Revisiting Depth-guided Methods for Monocular 3D Object Detection by Hierarchical
  Balanced Depth
section: Poster
openreview: HCWoFkGe8L4
abstract: Monocular 3D object detection has seen significant advancements with the
  incorporation of depth information. However, there remains a considerable performance
  gap compared to LiDAR-based methods, largely due to inaccurate depth estimation.
  We argue that this issue stems from the commonly used pixel-wise depth map loss,
  which inherently creates the imbalance of loss weighting between near and distant
  objects. To address these challenges, we propose MonoHBD (Monocular Hierarchical
  Balanced Depth), a comprehensive solution with the hierarchical mechanism. We introduce
  the Hierarchical Depth Map (HDM) structure that incorporates depth bins and depth
  offsets to enhance the localization accuracy for objects. Leveraging RoIAlign, our
  Balanced Depth Extractor (BDE) module captures both scene-level depth relationships
  and object-specific depth characteristics while considering the geometry properties
  through the inclusion of camera calibration parameters. Furthermore, we propose
  a novel depth map loss that regularizes object-level depth features to mitigate
  imbalanced loss propagation. Our model reaches state-of-the-art results on the KITTI
  3D object detection benchmark while supporting real-time detection. Excessive ablation
  studies are also conducted to prove the efficacy of our proposed modules.
