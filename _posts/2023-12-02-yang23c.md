title: 'Polybot: Training One Policy Across Robots While Embracing Variability'
section: Poster
openreview: HEIRj51lcS
abstract: 'Reusing large datasets is crucial to scale vision-based robotic manipulators
  to everyday scenarios due to the high cost of collecting robotic datasets. However,
  robotic platforms possess varying control schemes, camera viewpoints, kinematic
  configurations, and end-effector morphologies, posing significant challenges when
  transferring manipulation skills from one platform to another. To tackle this problem,
  we propose a set of key design decisions to train a single policy for deployment
  on multiple robotic platforms. Our framework first aligns the observation and action
  spaces of our policy across embodiments via utilizing wrist cameras and a unified,
  but modular codebase. To bridge the remaining domain shift, we align our policyâ€™s
  internal representations across embodiments via contrastive learning. We evaluate
  our method on a dataset collected over 60 hours spanning 6 tasks and 3 robots with
  varying joint configurations and sizes: the WidowX 250S, Franka Emika Panda, and
  Sawyer. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in success rate and sample
  efficiency for our policy when using new task data collected on a different robot,
  validating our proposed design decisions. More details and videos can be found on
