title: 'RVT: Robotic View Transformer for 3D Object Manipulation'
section: Oral
openreview: 0hPkttoGAf
abstract: 'For 3D object manipulation, methods that build an explicit 3D representation
  perform better than those relying only on camera images. But using explicit 3D representations
  like voxels comes at large computing cost, adversely affecting scalability. In this
  work, we propose RVT, a multi-view transformer for 3D manipulation that is both
  scalable and accurate. Some key features of RVT are an attention mechanism to aggregate
  information across views and re-rendering of the camera input from virtual views
  around the robot workspace. In simulations, we find that a single RVT model works
  well across 18 RLBench tasks with 249 task variations, achieving $26%$ higher relative
  success than the existing state-of-the-art method (PerAct). It also trains 36X faster
  than PerAct for achieving the same performance and achieves 2.3X the inference speed
  of PerAct. Further, RVT can perform a variety of manipulation tasks in the real
  world with just a few ($\sim$10) demonstrations per task. Visual results, code,
  and trained model are provided at: https://robotic-view-transformer.github.io/.'
