title: Learning to Drive Anywhere
section: Poster
openreview: 6a4sECAMCA
abstract: Human drivers can seamlessly adapt their driving decisions across geographical
  locations with diverse conditions and rules of the road, e.g., left vs. right-hand
  traffic. In contrast, existing models for autonomous driving have been thus far
  only deployed within restricted operational domains, i.e., without accounting for
  varying driving behaviors across locations or model scalability. In this work, we
  propose GeCo, a single geographically-aware conditional imitation learning (CIL)
  model that can efficiently learn from heterogeneous and globally distributed data
  with dynamic environmental, traffic, and social characteristics. Our key insight
  is to introduce a high-capacity, geo-location-based channel attention mechanism
  that effectively adapts to local nuances while also flexibly modeling similarities
  among regions in a data-driven manner. By optimizing a contrastive imitation objective,
  our proposed approach can efficiently scale across the inherently imbalanced data
  distributions and location-dependent events. We demonstrate the benefits of our
  GeCo agent across multiple datasets, cities, and scalable deployment paradigms,
  i.e., centralized, semi-supervised, and distributed agent training. Specifically,
  GeCo outperforms CIL baselines by over $14%$ in open-loop evaluation and $30%$ in
  closed-loop testing on CARLA.
