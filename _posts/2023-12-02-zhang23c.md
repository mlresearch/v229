title: 'FlowBot++: Learning Generalized Articulated Objects Manipulation via Articulation
  Projection'
section: Poster
openreview: psLlVbTFBua
abstract: Understanding and manipulating articulated objects, such as doors and drawers,
  is crucial for robots operating in human environments. We wish to develop a system
  that can learn to articulate novel objects with no prior interaction, after training
  on other articulated objects. Previous approaches for articulated object manipulation
  rely on either modular methods which are brittle or end-to-end methods, which lack
  generalizability. This paper presents FlowBot++, a deep 3D vision-based robotic
  system that predicts dense per-point motion and dense articulation parameters of
  articulated objects to assist in downstream manipulation tasks. FlowBot++ introduces
  a novel per-point representation of the articulated motion and articulation parameters
  that are combined to produce a more accurate estimate than either method on their
  own. Simulated experiments on the PartNet-Mobility dataset validate the performance
  of our system in articulating a wide range of objects, while real-world experiments
  on real objectsâ€™ point clouds and a Sawyer robot demonstrate the generalizability
  and feasibility of our system in real-world scenarios. Videos are available on our
