title: Distilled Feature Fields Enable Few-Shot Language-Guided Manipulation
section: Oral
openreview: Rb0nGIt_kh5
abstract: 'Self-supervised and language-supervised image models contain rich knowledge
  of the world that is important for generalization. Many robotic tasks, however,
  require a detailed understanding of 3D geometry, which is often lacking in 2D image
  features. This work bridges this 2D-to-3D gap for robotic manipulation by leveraging
  distilled feature fields to combine accurate 3D geometry with rich semantics from
  2D foundation models. We present a few-shot learning method for 6-DOF grasping and
  placing that harnesses these strong spatial and semantic priors to achieve in-the-wild
  generalization to unseen objects. Using features distilled from a vision-language
  model, CLIP, we present a way to designate novel objects for manipulation via free-text
  natural language, and demonstrate its ability to generalize to unseen expressions
  and novel categories of objects. Project website: https://f3rm.csail.mit.edu'
