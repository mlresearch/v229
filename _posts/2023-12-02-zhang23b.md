title: Learning Realistic Traffic Agents in Closed-loop
section: Poster
openreview: yobahDU4HPP
abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is crucial for developing self-driving software
  in a safe and scalable manner prior to real-world deployment. Typically, imitation
  learning (IL) is used to learn human-like traffic agents directly from real-world
  observations collected offline, but without explicit specification of traffic rules,
  agents trained from IL alone frequently display unrealistic infractions like collisions
  and driving off the road. This problem is exacerbated in out-of-distribution and
  long-tail scenarios. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) can train traffic
  agents to avoid infractions, but using RL alone results in unhuman-like driving
  behaviors. We propose Reinforcing Traffic Rules (RTR), a holistic closed-loop learning
  objective to match expert demonstrations under a traffic compliance constraint,
  which naturally gives rise to a joint IL + RL approach, obtaining the best of both
  worlds. Our method learns in closed-loop simulations of both nominal scenarios from
  real-world datasets as well as procedurally generated long-tail scenarios. Our experiments
  show that RTR learns more realistic and generalizable traffic simulation policies,
  achieving significantly better tradeoffs between human-like driving and traffic
  compliance in both nominal and long-tail scenarios. Moreover, when used as a data
  generation tool for training prediction models, our learned traffic policy leads
  to considerably improved downstream prediction metrics compared to baseline traffic
  agents.
