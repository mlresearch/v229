title: 'FindThis: Language-Driven Object Disambiguation in Indoor Environments'
section: Poster
openreview: nNsZxc2cmO
abstract: Natural language is naturally ambiguous. In this work, we consider interactions
  between a user and a mobile service robot tasked with locating a desired object,
  specified by a language utterance. We present a task FindThis, which addresses the
  problem of how to disambiguate and locate the particular object instance desired
  through a dialog with the user. To approach this problem we propose an algorithm,
  GoFind, which exploits visual attributes of the object that may be intrinsic (e.g.,
  color, shape), or extrinsic (e.g., location, relationships to other entities), expressed
  in an open vocabulary. GoFind leverages the visual common sense learned by large
  language models to enable fine-grained object localization and attribute differentiation
  in a zero-shot manner. We also provide a new visio-linguistic dataset, 3D Objects
  in Context (3DOC), for evaluating agents on this task consisting of Google Scanned
  Objects placed in Habitat-Matterport 3D scenes. Finally, we validate our approach
  on a real robot operating in an unstructured physical office environment using complex
  fine-grained language instructions.
