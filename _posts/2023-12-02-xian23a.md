title: 'ChainedDiffuser: Unifying Trajectory Diffusion and Keypose Prediction for
  Robotic Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: W0zgY2mBTA8
abstract: We present ChainedDiffuser, a policy architecture that unifies action keypose
  prediction and trajectory diffusion generation for learning robot manipulation from
  demonstrations. Our main innovation is to use a global transformer-based action
  predictor to predict actions at keyframes, a task that requires multi- modal semantic
  scene understanding, and to use a local trajectory diffuser to predict trajectory
  segments that connect predicted macro-actions. ChainedDiffuser sets a new record
  on established manipulation benchmarks, and outperforms both state-of-the-art keypose
  (macro-action) prediction models that use motion plan- ners for trajectory prediction,
  and trajectory diffusion policies that do not predict keyframe macro-actions. We
  conduct experiments in both simulated and real-world environments and demonstrate
  ChainedDiffuserâ€™s ability to solve a wide range of manipulation tasks involving
  interactions with diverse objects.
