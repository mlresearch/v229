title: Hierarchical Planning for Rope Manipulation using Knot Theory and a Learned
  Inverse Model
section: Poster
openreview: g_PPHV_GkX
abstract: 'This work considers planning the manipulation of deformable 1-dimensional
  objects, such as ropes or cables, specifically to tie knots. We propose TWISTED:
  Tying With Inverse model and Search in Topological space Excluding Demos, a hierarchical
  planning approach which, at the high level, uses ideas from knot-theory to plan
  a sequence of rope configurations, while at the low level uses a neural-network
  inverse model to move between the configurations in the high-level plan. To train
  the neural network, we propose a self-supervised approach, where we learn from random
  movements of the rope. To focus the random movements on interesting configurations,
  such as knots, we propose a non-uniform sampling method tailored for this domain.
  In a simulation, we show that our approach can plan significantly faster and more
  accurately than baselines. We also show that our plans are robust to parameter changes
  in the physical simulation, suggesting future applications via sim2real.'
