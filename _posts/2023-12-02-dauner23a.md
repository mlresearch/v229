title: Parting with Misconceptions about Learning-based Vehicle Motion Planning
section: Poster
openreview: o82EXEK5hu6
abstract: The release of nuPlan marks a new era in vehicle motion planning research,
  offering the first large-scale real-world dataset and evaluation schemes requiring
  both precise short-term planning and long-horizon ego-forecasting. Existing systems
  struggle to simultaneously meet both requirements. Indeed, we find that these tasks
  are fundamentally misaligned and should be addressed independently. We further assess
  the current state of closed-loop planning in the field, revealing the limitations
  of learning-based methods in complex real-world scenarios and the value of simple
  rule-based priors such as centerline selection through lane graph search algorithms.
  More surprisingly, for the open-loop sub-task, we observe that the best results
  are achieved when using only this centerline as scene context (i.e., ignoring all
  information regarding the map and other agents). Combining these insights, we propose
  an extremely simple and efficient planner which outperforms an extensive set of
  competitors, winning the nuPlan planning challenge 2023.
