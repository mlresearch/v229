title: 'GNFactor: Multi-Task Real Robot Learning with Generalizable Neural Feature
  Fields'
section: Oral
openreview: b1tl3aOt2R2
abstract: 'It is a long-standing problem in robotics to develop agents capable of
  executing diverse manipulation tasks from visual observations in unstructured real-world
  environments. To achieve this goal, the robot will need to have a comprehensive
  understanding of the 3D structure and semantics of the scene. In this work, we present
  GNFactor, a visual behavior cloning agent for multi-task robotic manipulation with
  Generalizable Neural feature Fields. GNFactor jointly optimizes a neural radiance
  field (NeRF) as a reconstruction module and a Perceiver Transformer as a decision-making
  module, leveraging a shared deep 3D voxel representation. To incorporate semantics
  in 3D, the reconstruction module incorporates a vision-language foundation model
  (e.g., Stable Diffusion) to distill rich semantic information into the deep 3D voxel.
  We evaluate GNFactor on 3 real-robot tasks and perform detailed ablations on 10
  RLBench tasks with a limited number of demonstrations. We observe a substantial
  improvement of GNFactor over current state-of-the-art methods in seen and unseen
  tasks, demonstrating the strong generalization ability of GNFactor. Project website:
