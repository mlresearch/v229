section: Poster
openreview: JdpleC92J4
abstract: 'Diligently gathered human demonstrations serve as the unsung heroes empowering
  the progression of robot learning. Today, demonstrations are collected by training
  people to use specialized controllers, which (tele-)operate robots to manipulate
  a small number of objects. By contrast, we introduce AR2-D2: a system for collecting
  demonstrations which (1) does not require people with specialized training, (2)
  does not require any real robots during data collection, and therefore, (3) enables
  manipulation of diverse objects with a real robot. AR2-D2 is a framework in the
  form of an iOS app that people can use to record a video of themselves manipulating
  any object while simultaneously capturing essential data modalities for training
  a real robot. We show that data collected via our system enables the training of
  behavior cloning agents in manipulating real objects. Our experiments further show
  that training with our AR data is as effective as training with real-world robot
  demonstrations. Moreover, our user study indicates that users find AR2-D2 intuitive
  to use and require no training in contrast to four other frequently employed methods
  for collecting robot demonstrations.'
