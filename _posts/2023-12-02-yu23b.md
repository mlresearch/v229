  Construction'
section: Poster

abstract: We propose a novel end-to-end pipeline for online long-range vectorized
  high-definition (HD) map construction using on-board camera sensors. The vectorized
  representation of HD maps, employing polylines and polygons to represent map elements,
  is widely used by downstream tasks. However, previous schemes designed with reference
  to dynamic object detection overlook the structural constraints within linear map
  elements, resulting in performance degradation in long-range scenarios. In this
  paper, we exploit the properties of map elements to improve the performance of map
  construction. We extract more accurate birdâ€™s eye view (BEV) features guided by
  their linear structure, and then propose a hierarchical sparse map representation
  to further leverage the scalability of vectorized map elements, and design a progressive
  decoding mechanism and a supervision strategy based on this representation. Our
  approach, ScalableMap, demonstrates superior performance on the nuScenes dataset,
  especially in long-range scenarios, surpassing previous state-of-the-art model by
  6.5 mAP while achieving 18.3 FPS.
