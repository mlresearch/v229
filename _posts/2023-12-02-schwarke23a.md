title: Curiosity-Driven Learning of Joint Locomotion and Manipulation Tasks
section: Poster
openreview: QG_ERxtDAP-
abstract: Learning complex locomotion and manipulation tasks presents significant
  challenges, often requiring extensive engineering of, e.g., reward functions or
  curricula to provide meaningful feedback to the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm.
  This paper proposes an intrinsically motivated RL approach to reduce task-specific
  engineering. The desired task is encoded in a single sparse reward, i.e., a reward
  of â€œ+1" is given if the task is achieved. Intrinsic motivation enables learning
  by guiding exploration toward the sparse reward signal. Specifically, we adapt the
  idea of Random Network Distillation (RND) to the robotics domain to learn holistic
  motion control policies involving simultaneous locomotion and manipulation. We investigate
  opening doors as an exemplary task for robotic ap- plications. A second task involving
  package manipulation from a table to a bin highlights the generalization capabilities
  of the presented approach. Finally, the resulting RL policies are executed in real-world
  experiments on a wheeled-legged robot in biped mode. We experienced no failure in
  our experiments, which consisted of opening push doors (over 15 times in a row)
  and manipulating packages (over 5 times in a row).
