  Score Matching'

abstract: 'Gradient-based methods enable efficient search capabilities in high dimensions.
  However, in order to apply them effectively in offline optimization paradigms such
  as offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Imitation Learning (IL), we require a
  more careful consideration of how uncertainty estimation interplays with first-order
  methods that attempt to minimize them. We study smoothed distance to data as an
  uncertainty metric, and claim that it has two beneficial properties: (i) it allows
  gradient-based methods that attempt to minimize uncertainty to drive iterates to
  data as smoothing is annealed, and (ii) it facilitates analysis of model bias with
  Lipschitz constants. As distance to data can be expensive to compute online, we
  consider settings where we need amortize this computation. Instead of learning the
  distance however, we propose to learn its gradients directly as an oracle for first-order
  optimizers. We show these gradients can be efficiently learned with score-matching
  techniques by leveraging the equivalence between distance to data and data likelihood.
  Using this insight, we propose Score-Guided Planning (SGP), a planning algorithm
  for offline RL that utilizes score-matching to enable first-order planning in high-dimensional
  problems, where zeroth-order methods were unable to scale, and ensembles were unable
  to overcome local minima. Website: https://sites.google.com/view/score-guided-planning/home'
