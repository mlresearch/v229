title: Large Language Models as General Pattern Machines
section: Poster
openreview: RcZMI8MSyE
abstract: We observe that pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are capable of
  autoregressively completing complex token sequences–from arbitrary ones procedurally
  generated by probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFG), to more rich spatial patterns
  found in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a general AI benchmark, prompted
  in the style of ASCII art. Surprisingly, pattern completion proficiency can be partially
  retained even when the sequences are expressed using tokens randomly sampled from
  the vocabulary. These results suggest that without any additional training, LLMs
  can serve as general sequence modelers, driven by in-context learning. In this work,
  we investigate how these zero-shot capabilities may be applied to problems in robotics–from
  extrapolating sequences of numbers that represent states over time to complete simple
  motions, to least-to-most prompting of reward-conditioned trajectories that can
  discover and represent closed-loop policies (e.g., a stabilizing controller for
  CartPole). While difficult to deploy today for real systems due to latency, context
  size limitations, and compute costs, the approach of using LLMs to drive low-level
  control may provide an exciting glimpse into how the patterns among words could
  be transferred to actions.
