abstract: We propose BOSS, an approach that automatically learns to solve new long-horizon,
  complex, and meaningful tasks by growing a learned skill library with minimal supervision.
  Prior work in reinforcement learning require expert supervision, in the form of
  demonstrations or rich reward functions, to learn long-horizon tasks. Instead, our
  approach BOSS (BOotStrapping your own Skills) learns to accomplish new tasks by
  performing "skill bootstrapping," where an agent with a set of primitive skills
  interacts with the environment to practice new skills without receiving reward feedback
  for tasks outside of the initial skill set. This bootstrapping phase is guided by
  large language models (LLMs) that inform the agent of meaningful skills to chain
  together. Through this process, BOSS builds a wide range of complex and useful behaviors
  from a basic set of primitive skills. We demonstrate through experiments in realistic
  household environments that agents trained with our LLM-guided bootstrapping procedure
  outperform those trained with naive bootstrapping as well as prior unsupervised
  skill acquisition methods on zero-shot execution of unseen, long-horizon tasks in
  new environments. Website at clvrai.com/boss.
