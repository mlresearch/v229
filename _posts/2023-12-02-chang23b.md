title: Context-Aware Entity Grounding with Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Graphs
section: Poster
openreview: cjEI5qXoT0
abstract: We present an Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Graph (OVSG), a formal framework
  for grounding a variety of entities, such as object instances, agents, and regions,
  with free-form text-based queries. Unlike conventional semantic-based object localization
  approaches, our system facilitates context-aware entity localization, allowing for
  queries such as “pick up a cup on a kitchen table" or “navigate to a sofa on which
  someone is sitting". In contrast to existing research on 3D scene graphs, OVSG supports
  free-form text input and open-vocabulary querying. Through a series of comparative
  experiments using the ScanNet dataset and a self-collected dataset, we demonstrate
  that our proposed approach significantly surpasses the performance of previous semantic-based
  localization techniques. Moreover, we highlight the practical application of OVSG
  in real-world robot navigation and manipulation experiments. The code and dataset
  used for evaluation will be made available upon publication.
