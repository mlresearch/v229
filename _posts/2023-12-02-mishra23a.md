title: 'Generative Skill Chaining: Long-Horizon Skill Planning with Diffusion Models'
section: Poster
openreview: HtJE9ly5dT
abstract: 'Long-horizon tasks, usually characterized by complex subtask dependencies,
  present a significant challenge in manipulation planning. Skill chaining is a practical
  approach to solving unseen tasks by combining learned skill priors. However, such
  methods are myopic if sequenced greedily and face scalability issues with search-based
  planning strategy. To address these challenges, we introduce Generative Skill Chaining
  (GSC), a probabilistic framework that learns skill-centric diffusion models and
  composes their learned distributions to generate long-horizon plans during inference.
  GSC samples from all skill models in parallel to efficiently solve unseen tasks
  while enforcing geometric constraints. We evaluate the method on various long-horizon
  tasks and demonstrate its capability in reasoning about action dependencies, constraint
  handling, and generalization, along with its ability to replan in the face of perturbations.
  We show results in simulation and on real robot to validate the efficiency and scalability
  of GSC, highlighting its potential for advancing long-horizon task planning. More
