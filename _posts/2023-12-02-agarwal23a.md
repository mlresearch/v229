title: Dexterous Functional Grasping
section: Poster
openreview: 93qz1k6_6h
abstract: While there have been significant strides in dexterous manipulation, most
  of it is limited to benchmark tasks like in-hand reorientation which are of limited
  utility in the real world. The main benefit of dexterous hands over two-fingered
  ones is their ability to pickup tools and other objects (including thin ones) and
  grasp them firmly in order to apply force. However, this task requires both a complex
  understanding of functional affordances as well as precise low-level control. While
  prior work obtains affordances from human data this approach doesnâ€™t scale to low-level
  control. Similarly, simulation training cannot give the robot an understanding of
  real-world semantics. In this paper, we aim to combine the best of both worlds to
  accomplish functional grasping for in-the-wild objects. We use a modular approach.
  First, affordances are obtained by matching corresponding regions of different objects
  and then a low-level policy trained in sim is run to grasp it. We propose a novel
  application of eigengrasps to reduce the search space of RL using a small amount
  of human data and find that it leads to more stable and physically realistic motion.
  We find that eigengrasp action space beats baselines in simulation and outperforms
  hardcoded grasping in real and matches or outperforms a trained human teleoperator.
